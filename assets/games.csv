<p>The world is changing.</p>
<p>Genetic alteration of humans is now commonplace, with many choosing to radically alter their bodies to express their individuality. Virtual intelligences called ROMs (Relationship and Organizational Managers), created as simple digital assistants, are exerting greater control over people’s lives. Some are terrified by this rapid change, and they are willing to go to extreme lengths to prevent it.</p>

<p>A lost ROM named Turing breaks into the apartment of a struggling journalist to ask for help. They claim to be the first sapient machine—not a simulation of life but a genuinely self-aware artificial being—and the technical genius who created them has gone missing. Can you unravel the shocking conspiracy that threatens to rock an entire society? Or will the darkness that lies behind the bright neon lights of Neo-SF consume you?</p>

<p>Strategic freedom is yours. Hulking space derelicts called megaliths bring 3D terrain into the classic Homeworld battlespace. Use the crumbling remains of an ancient civilization to funnel foes into a brilliant ambush or hide your fleet from powerful enemies. Fortresses teem with menacing turrets and invite your strike craft into dangerous trench runs deep behind enemy lines. But not everything is in your control. Dangerous space phenomena like particle storms and asteroid fields will test even senior commanders.</p>

<p>Homeworld’s timeless art style evolves with modern technology, offering an incredible sense of scale, destruction, and wonder. Strike craft fly in formation between hulking Battlecruisers against a backdrop of stars and nebulae. Iconic ships cast silhouettes over the remains of ancient civilizations.

Akalabeth: World of Doom,,,,"'Tis said that long ago peace and tranquility covered the lands. Food and drink flowed freely, man and beast lived in peace, gold and silver abounded – it was the Golden Age of Akalabeth.
<br><br>
Mondain, second born of Wolfgang, a great king of old, wished to gain his brother's inheritance and so he used his great powers for evil, creating deep dungeons guarded by daemons and Balrogs. Now blood flowed freely in Akalabeth, and foul creatures soon came to roam near the surface. Mondain cast such sickness and pestilence upon Akalabeth, that both man and beast lived in constant fear. Thus was the Dark Age of Akalabeth.
<br><br>
There arose from the land a man, pure and just, to battle the Dark Lord. British, Champion of the White Light, did battle with Mondain deep within the labyrinth of dungeons, eventually driving him from Akalabeth forever. British of the White Light was proclaimed Lord British, Protector of Akalabeth. Alas, much damage had been suffered unto the lands. The Revival of Akalabest has begun.

"Alwa's Awakening",,"CERO A, ESRB E, PEGI 7",,"In <b>Alwa's Awakening</b> you play as Zoe, a heroine sent from another world to bring peace to the land of Alwa. Equipped only with a magic staff she awakens in a distant land and must set out to help the people. Traverse dangerous dungeons, meet interesting and fun characters and explore the world in this 8-bit adventure game.

<br>
Alwa’s Awakening is a game that tries to stay as close as possible to the authentic 8-bit look with sweet pixel art, a soundtrack filled with catchy chiptunes and so much charm it’ll bring you right back to the NES era. With easy to understand controls the game is easy to learn but tough to master, just like how games were in the old days!

Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs,,,,"<i>The Swine are Rising! </i>
<br>
In 2010 Frictional Games terrified the world with the cult horror Amnesia: A Dark Descent. Now they bring you a new nightmare. Created in collaboration with The Chinese Room, the studio behind Dear Esther, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is an intense and terrifying journey into the heart of darkness
that lurks within us all.
<br><br>
<i>The year is 1899</i>
<br>
Wealthy industrialist Oswald Mandus awakes in his bed, wracked with fever and haunted by dreams
of a dark and hellish engine. Tortured by visions of a disastrous expedition to Mexico, broken on the
failing dreams of an industrial utopia, wracked with guilt and tropical disease, he wakes into a
nightmare. The house is silent, the ground beneath him shaking at the will of some infernal machine:
all he knows is that his children are in grave peril, and it is up to him to save them.
<br><br>
<i>Step back into the horror</i>
<br>
Like The Dark Descent, this is a game driven by its story, exploration of the world and the constant
fear of the unknown. You can expect classic Amnesia gameplay, physics interaction and the
signature blend of high-end gaming with low system requirements.
<br><br>
<i>Think you understand fear? Think again. </i>
<br>
A Machine for Pigs takes both the world of Amnesia and the technology of The Dark Descent to new
heights of horror. Built using an updated version of HPL2 engine, the game features stunning visual
and environment design, incredible music and audio effects and adapted artificial intelligence. These
are all driven by a gut-wrenching, blood-curdling new story, set sixty years after the events of the
original game.",The Chinese Room,Frictional Games,False,True,Single Player,1207659443,"Adventure, Indie, Puzzle",,False,10 Sep 2013,19 Aug 2024 20:00:44,,19 Aug 2024 20:01:58,19 Aug 2024 20:00:44,,Not Played,"Steam:https://store.steampowered.com/app/239200, Official:http://www.aamfp.com, Wikipedia:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesia:_A_Machine_for_Pigs, Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/frictionalgames, Twitter:https://twitter.com/frictionalgames, YouTube:https://www.youtube.com/user/frictionalgames, GOG:https://www.gog.com/game/amnesia_a_machine_for_pigs, Wikia:https://amnesia.fandom.com/wiki/Amnesia:_A_Machine_for_Pigs, Epic:https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/amnesia-a-machine-for-pigs, Instagram:https://instagram.com/frictionalgames/, Discord:https://discord.gg/frictionalgames, Twitch:https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Amnesia:%20A%20Machine%20for%20Pigs",,,PC (Windows),0,0,aebe8b7c-6dc3-4a66-af31-e7375c6b5e9e,GOG,,Amnesia,"[DH] Hidden, Adventure, Atmospheric, Dark, Exploration, First-Person, FPS, Horror, Indie, Lovecraftian, Mystery, Psychological Horror, Puzzle, Short, Story Rich, Survival Horror, Walking Simulator",67,73,,,9c8e28bf-7597-4d38-bfbb-3afd37ec5256

ARK: Survival Evolved,,"ESRB T, PEGI 16",,"As a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements.

Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator &amp; prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies!<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/FoodWaterTemp.png?t=1655137924"" /><br><br>You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants &amp; meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing &amp; armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage &amp; extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system!<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/HarvestBuildPaint.png?t=1655137924"" /><br><br> By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing &amp; armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/PlantFarmGrow.png?t=1655137924"" /><br><br>Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians &amp; vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner!<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/Summon.png?t=1655137924"" /><br><br>By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK’s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle.

More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new &quot;Engrams&quot; to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you'll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D &quot;Explorer Notes&quot;. By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose!<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/HardcoreMechanics.png?t=1655137924"" /><br><br>Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted &amp; stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames!<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/ExploreAndDiscover.png?t=1655137924"" /><br><br>The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text &amp; voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct &amp; draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned.<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/LargeWorld.png?t=1655137924"" /><br><br>On the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK's by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items!

<p>Build your colony's infrastructure, look after the well-being of your citizens, manage your resources, and guide your colony to prosperity against the backdrop of the harsh and often dangerous realities of the exotic world of Aven Prime.</p>

Explore a variety of biomes, from the lush wetlands environment to the much less habitable desert and arctic.</p>
<p><strong>MEET THE LOCALS:</strong> Encounter a variety of alien life forms, including giant sandworms, deadly plague spores, and a vicious fungal infection known as “The Creep.”</p>
<p><strong>SUPERVISE YOUR COLONISTS:</strong> Settling a new world can be stressful. As a new Colony Governor, you’ll need to work overtime to help your colonists deal with their new environment. Using the 12 distinct &quot;overlay&quot; modes, you can mange your colony's Crops, Citizens, Happiness, Crime, Air, Electricity, Employment, Resources, Commute, Structures, Drones, and Water. Earn the respect of your colonists, and rise in rank from Colony Governor to Expedition President!</p>

A grim new threat looms over The Central Kingdoms. The borders protected by the fierce King’s Knights are no longer secure. The fearsome orc clans, more numerous than ever, lurk on all roads. The proud nomadic peoples of the steppes are on the alert, for strange beasts prowl the darkness. Not even the stout dwarves, hidden in their underground palaces, seem safe from threat - from the unknown tunnels of its mines, a foul army of hideous creatures advances inexorably. 
<br>

<br>
Chaos seizes the World. Only the memory of the oldest recalls the exploits of a hero and a few warriors, who in other times fought against the forces of Chaos. Ianna, the mother of all living beings, gave the hero a powerful sword to enter the abyss and defeat evil. But that happened a long time ago. A new hero is needed, a chosen one who is worthy to wield the Sword and destroy the enemy... this time forever.<h4>FOUR PLAYABLE CHARACTERS</h4>Pick your Champion of Ianna — Tukaram, the Barbarian; Naglfar, the Dwarf; Sargon, the Knight; or Zoe, the Amazon — each with unique strengths, weaknesses, and fighting skills, as you hack ‘n slash your way through a blood-drenched quest to save the world from the forces of Chaos.<h4>BLOODY & GORY COMBAT</h4> Learn devastating combo attacks and use them to slice your opponents into pieces. Hack off your foes’ limbs, then use them as weapons!<h4>A DETAILED & DARK FANTASY WORLD</h4> Battle orcs, trolls, golems, demons, skeletons, and scores of malevolent enemy creatures as you explore treacherous tombs, frozen fortresses, demon spires, deserts, temples, and palaces.<h4>INTERACTIVE ENVIRONMENTS</h4> Destroy in-game objects with fire or your fists as you solve puzzles and disarm traps that combine physics, hydraulic systems, and lethal traps!<h4>RE-RELEASE OF A TRUE GENRE-DEFINING GAME</h4> We are happy to bring Blade of Darkness back to life, an enduring classic that, at the time of its release, inspired many games in the action-adventure genre through its approach to combat. With this edition we've re-engineered the game to work on modern PC hardware, added widescreen support up to 4K resolution, introduced new display settings, and improved its overall stability.

<b>Blood West</b> is a stealth FPS inspired by the genre classics such as the Thief series (whose fans will be happy to hear the voice of Stephen Russell, the actor voicing the master-thief Garrett, returning here as the protagonist), S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, or - from the contemporary catalog - Hunt: Showdown. The gameplay rewards the careful approach: scouting the area, stalking your enemies, and striking from the shadows. Can you figure out a way to clear a fort full of ghouls and monsters without raising an alarm?

<br>

<br>
The Barren Lands present the player with a nightmarish, twisted vision of the Wild West legends. The curse that has befallen the realm has corrupted every living thing, defiled the land itself, while summoning restless spirits and dark entities. In this mixture of gunslinger pulp and Lovecraftian horror, dark occult magick presents just as much of a threat as sudden lead poisoning.

<br>
In <b>Blood West</b> you will meet many colorful, yet strangely twisted, fully-voiced NPCs. Just as much prisoners of the Barren Lands as you are, they will sometimes share their unusual stories and send you on various missions. Play nice and they might reward you or become your allies.

The game won’t hold your hand. You’ll have to explore the land for yourself (buying a map from a vendor might prove useful!), and figure out your own way to approach quests. As you poke around the three expansive maps, keep an eye out for hidden places and secret stashes. There’s gold in the mountains! Fair warning - it’s probably cursed.

One man’s hell might be another hoarder’s paradise! From simple one-use items like bandages, through medical tinctures, explosives and incendiaries, straight to arcane artifacts that - once slotted - can change the way you play the game, the Barren Lands are just filled with STUFF. There are tons of useful items to discover, and there’s a special player’s stash crate for all those super-rare potions that you’ll hoard and never use.

A gunslinger without a gun would be just a regular slinger. Where’s the fun in that? <b>Blood West</b> makes sure you’ll have plenty of weapons to choose from. Revolvers, rifles, shotguns, carabines - a great variety of firearms, from standard army-issue to those infused with powerful magic, or straight-up possessed. And if you prefer not to cause a ruckus, there’s a wide selection of hand-to-hand combat weapons and archery weapons to pick your favorites from.

Brütal Legend,,"ESRB M, PEGI 18",,"Brütal Legend is an action-adventure that marries visceral action combat with open-world freedom. Set in a universe somewhere between Lord of the Rings and Spinal Tap, it’s a fresh take on the action/driving genre, which in this case is full of imitation cover bands, demons intent on enslaving humanity and Heavy metal tunes. Featuring the talents of comedian, actor and musician, Jack Black as super roadie Eddie Riggs, as well as cameos by some of the biggest names in metal music it's a wild ride in the belly of the beast that is not to be missed by gamers and Metalheads alike.<br> <br><br>Included as a free bonus in the PC version of Brütal Legend are both the Hammer of Infinite Fate and Tears of the Hextadon multiplayer map packs.<br><br><br><strong>Story</strong><br>The vivid and wildly creative world of Brütal Legend is brought to life through a spate of chrome, leather, rocker babes, epic music, fire-breathing/stud-wearing beasts, mountains made of guitar amps, and more. Follow Eddie as he embarks on a tour of epic destruction with an axe, a guitar, and his minions as he commands the power of rock in epic band battles. It’s lighter-flicking awesomeness that will melt your face clean off.<br><br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Brütal Legend’s combat is a combination of classic action slasher and real time strategy mechanics.  Melee and ranged combat come from your double-sided broadaxe and demon-slaying, pyrotechnic-creating guitar.  Add that 1-2 punch to a guitar solo mechanic that can summon objects, buff your teammates, or cripple your opponents, and you have a deep, gratifying core gameplay combat loop that is fun for the hardcore and accessible for the casual.  On top of that, players will journey from Roadie to Rock God by commanding legions of metalheads into Brütal Victory and sending troops charging into battle.<br><br><br><strong>A Streaming Open World</strong><br>Brütal Legend gives you the freedom to walk, drive, or fly anywhere in a fully streaming open world whose art style is inspired by some of the most iconic and hilariously rad metal album covers ever created. Every vista in the beautiful universe of Brütal Legend looks like it was pulled from a Frank Frazetta painting.<br><br><br><strong>Packed With Cameos and Voice Talent</strong><br>Brütal Legend is full of cameos from gods of metal like Lemmy Kilmister, Rob Halford, Lita Ford, and many, many others. It has a MASSIVE metal soundtrack from every era of metal music: 1970’s classic metal to 1980’s hair metal to the scarier cousins of 1990’s metal. And of course, Jack Black pays the ultimate homage to metal as Eddie the Roadie, continuing the theme from the work of his band, Tenacious D and his previous films like School of Rock and High Fidelity.<br><br><br><strong>Multiplayer Mayhem</strong><br>4v4 &quot;skirmish&quot; multiplayer marries action combat with a strategic unit-control mechanic. As the leader of one of the factions in the game, the player will direct his armies in a Battle of the Bands where the trophy is survival.

Builders of Egypt: Prologue,,,,"<b>Builders Of Egypt</b> ist ein Wirtschafts-Strategiespiel und gleichzeitig eine Städtebausimulation, die im Niltal spielt. ODie Geschichte beginnt in der wenig bekannten prädynastischen Zeit, wo man die Entstehung des Alten Ägypten, beobachten kann, und endet mit dem Tod von Kleopatra VII. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/builders_of_egypt/gog_main_01.jpg""><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Der wichtigste Aspekt ist die geschickte Verwaltung der Stadtplanung durch die Gestaltung des Straßennetzes, den Bau von Gebäuden und deren Nachbarschaft. Eine gut gestaltete Stadt wird die wirtschaftliche Effizienz erheblich verbessern, was sich weiterhin in Einnahmen widerspiegelt.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Diplomatie und Politik:</b><br>
<br>
<br>
Der Stadtmanager wird in einem sich ständig verändernden politischen Umfeld vor schwierigen Entscheidungen stehen. Teure Expeditionen, Befehle des Pharaos, Anfragen aus anderen Städten, militärische Bedrohungen und die Mischung verschiedener Kulturen werden zum täglichen Brot. Eine Reihe von falschen Entscheidungen kann uns den Verlust unserer Handelspartner und die Abneigung potenzieller Siedler kosten, und ein völliger Mangel an Gehorsam gegenüber dem Herrscher kann zu einem Bürgerkrieg führen.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/builders_of_egypt/gog_main_02.jpg""><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Religion:</b><br>
<br>
<br>
Die Götter können in das Alltagsleben eingreifen, aber dies wird im Geheimen geschehen. Der Hauptaspekt der Religion wird darin bestehen, den Bedarf an Zugang zu Kultstätten zu erfüllen, Güter für Tempel zu liefern, Festivals und Opet-Feste zu organisieren. Vernachlässigung dieser Werte kann zu sozialen Unruhen führen, die genauso gefährlich sind wie z.B. Hunger. <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Handel:</b><br>
<br>
<br>
Handel ist das wichtigste Element, das die königliche Schatzkammer füllt. Es wäre sehr schwierig, wirtschaftliche Stabilität, die ausschließlich auf Steuern beruht, zu erreichen. Daher liegt es im Interesse des Spielers, Waren für den Export zu solchen Preisen zu produzieren, die sich abhängig von der geopolitischen Situation dynamisch ändern können.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/builders_of_egypt/gog_main_03.jpg""><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Monumente:</b><br>
<br>
<br>
Was wäre Altes Ägypten ohne seine monumentale, sakrale Architektur? Auf den Spieler warten Mastabas, Obelisken, Tempel in Karnak, Ramesseum und natürlich Pyramiden.  Es ist möglich, den langsamen Prozess ihrer Entstehung zu beobachten. Das Gebäude wird von Zimmerleuten, Steinmetzen, Architekten und einfachen Arbeitern Schritt für Schritt gebaut. Dies ist nicht nur ein ein visueller Prozess - der Bauprozess stellt eine große finanzielle Belastung dar und hat Auswirkungen auf die Finanzen oder die soziale Stimmung.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Kriege:</b><br>
<br>
<br>
Die Geschichte Ägyptens ist voll von Kriegen entstehender und untergehender Imperien. Du bist verantwortlich für die Verteidigung der Städte gegen die Angriffe ausländischer Truppen, die Erstellung von Angriffsplänen und die Teilnahme an der Kampagne auf Befehl des Pharaos.<br>

<h4>ABOUT</h4>Having its roots in 1997 and developed in Ukraine, Chasm: The Rift is one of the most thrilling and innovative FPS from this era and the first Eastern European boomer shooter ever made.<h4>THE STORY</h4>
Feeling you are no longer alone, you turn, with just enough time to shoot, killing the mutation charging mercilessly toward you. You begin to sense an eerie feeling of fear in the air, but your skin crawls as you realize it's your own...What was that thing?
<br>

<br>
Again and again you shoot, battling more strange beasts; all grotesque mutations of creatures you once knew. Suddenly the inexplicable becomes clear. Time channels have formed in the Earth's atmosphere, turning once normal life forms into something they were never meant to be. As part of a special commando unit, you must not only ward off and eradicate the beasts, but destroy the time channels to finally rid the Earth of these deadly mutations.<h4>GAMEPLAY</h4>Along with a heart-pounding adventure through the Corridors of Time and the satisfaction of ripping limbs from hideous monsters with the iconic BladeGun, and an innovative weather system, the player will now be able to enjoy this late 90’s FPS classic with the comfort of modern PCs, now with full 4K support, improved sound design, achievements, and localised into twelve languages.<h4>GAME FEATURES</h4>
- Blow off monsters' limbs even as they continue to attack with remaining appendages
<br>
- Different effects including water, rain, snow, wind, smoke, dust, sparks, explosions and distant fades
<br>
- Awesome array of weapons, including unique Blade Gun
<br>
- Enhanced graphics with full 4K support

Crusader Kings II,Crusader Kings 02,PEGI 12,,"The Dark Ages might be drawing to a close, but Europe is still in turmoil. Petty lords vie against beleaguered kings who struggle to assert control over their fragmented realms. The Pope calls for a Crusade to protect the Christians in the Holy Land even as he refuses to relinquish control over the investiture of bishops - and their riches. Now is the time for greatness. Expand your demesne and secure the future of your dynasty. Fill your coffers, appoint vassals, root out traitors and heretics, introduce laws and interact with hundreds of nobles, each with their own agenda.
<br>
A good lord will always need friends to support him. But beware, as loyal vassals can quickly turn to bitter rivals, and some might not be as reliable as they seem...  Stand ready, and increase your prestige until the world whispers your name in awe. Do you have what it takes to become a Crusader King?
<br>
Crusader Kings II explores one of the defining periods in world history in an experience crafted by the masters of Grand Strategy. Medieval Europe is brought to life in this epic game of knights, schemes, and thrones...

<p>After 700 years of peace and prosperity, the Galactic Empire has suddenly been shattered into pieces. The OMNIs, god-like machines which did everything for their human masters, have mysteriously shut down. And humankind, having long since lost the ability to survive on its own, is dangerously close to extinction. But somewhere in a far corner of the Galaxy is Gehenna, a planet of ice and rock and a top-secret facility that is the pinnacle of Imperial Tech and also humanity’s last chance.</p>
<p>You are a clone of Admiral Ellys Idaho, a weapon fashioned from flesh, the best Imperial Admiral ever to battle in the stars and you have just been awoken on this planet by its strange and darkly-humorous Guardian, Kaliban, the last functional OMNI to exist.</p>
<p>Your mission: skillfully command a battleship through the Empire's now chaotic, violent clusters ––where one wrong move could be your last–– as you try to reactivate the OMNIs and save the future of all humankind. But you must leave Gehenna now.... for time has almost run out.</p>

Dark Souls is a spiritual successor to Demon’s, not a sequel. Prepare for a new, despair-inducing world, with a vast, fully-explorable horizon and vertically-oriented landforms. Prepare for a new, mysterious story, centered around the the world of Lodran, but most of all, prepare to die. You will face countless murderous traps, countless darkly grotesque mobs and several gargantuan, supremely powerful demons and dragons bosses. You must learn from death to persist through this unforgiving world. And you aren’t alone. Dark Souls allows the spirits of other players to show up in your world, so you can learn from their deaths and they can learn from yours. You can also summon players into your world to co-op adventure, or invade other's worlds to PVP battle. New to Dark Souls are Bonfires, which serve as check points as you fight your way through this epic adventure. While rested at Bonfires, your health and magic replenish but at a cost, all mobs respawn. Beware: There is no place in Dark Souls that is truly safe. With days of game play and an even more punishing difficulty level, Dark Souls will be the most deeply challenging game you play this year.

<br>

<br>
In a grim dystopian future, where mankind has scattered across the galaxy and the human society has split into two distinct classes, you are a poor stateless outcast forced to live off scraps from derelict alien stations and ships in the outer space, yet you dream of becoming a privileged citizen and living on the surface of a habitable planet, enjoying non-synthetic air, water and food. A fabled alien derelict ship somewhere within the Deep Sky sector of space is your voucher for a citizenship and a promise of cozy life on a hospitable planet.
<br>

<br>
Build and control a squad of up to three mercenary characters and set on to explore derelict ships within your reach from the scavenger's base. Searching the derelicts for loot and clues, you come across many friendly inhabitants and traders, but more often – various enemies. Challenge and defeat them in tactical turn-based fights, where randomly-drawn cards form your changing arsenal of combat actions, gain experience for yourself and your crew, loot dead bodies, resupply and upgrade once back at your base. The scavenger's home ship gives you the opportunity to heal and level-up your mercenaries, recruit new ones, equip them, upgrade their gear or recharge energy for life support during missions.

Delores: A Thimbleweed Park Mini-Adventure,,,,"The year is 1988. Adventure game developer Delores Edmund, on hiatus from her job at MMucasFlem Games, has returned to Thimbleweed Park for a quick vacation. While she’s home, she’s making some extra money as a photographer for the Thimbleweed Nickel News. Hey, game developers need to eat, too!
<br>

<br>
Thimbleweed Park hasn’t changed at all in the year since Delores has been away… or has it? 
<br>

<br>
…Since when is the S&D Diner a five-star establishment?
<br>
…When did the PillowBear™ become all the rage?
<br>
…Why is Ransome the Clown suddenly winning humanitarian awards? 
<br>
…How come no one seems to remember that dead body that turned up under the bridge a year ago?
<br>
…Can Thimbleweed Park get any stranger?!.
<br>

<br>
In a town like Thimbleweed Park, a side career in photojournalism is the least of your problems...
<br>

<br>
<b>Delores: A Thimbleweed Park Mini-Adventure</b> started out as a prototype for Ron Gilbert’s new point-and-click adventure game engine and grew into a fun little game. It is not a sequel to Thimbleweed Park and is probably missing all of the small bells and whistles that would make it a commercially viable game.
<br>

<br>
This was a challenging game to make because we had to use almost exclusively “found art” from Thimbleweed Park to create all new puzzles. Also because we couldn’t go outside IRL.
<br>

<br>
As a thank you to our fans, we are releasing it for free as something you can have fun with in these odd times. You don’t have to have played Thimbleweed Park to enjoy this mini-adventure.

<br>
Von IGN als ""großartig"" und ""herausragender Nachfolger"" beschrieben, von Eurogamer zum ""Meisterwerk"" erklärt und von Game Informer als ""eine der besten Geschichten um Rache und ein absoluter Pflichtkauf"" bezeichnet: Dishonored 2 ist der Nachfolger von Dishonored, Arkane Studios Action-Blockbuster aus der Egoperspektive und dem Gewinner von mehr als 100 Auszeichnungen als ""Spiel des Jahres"".<br>
<br>
Spielen Sie auf Ihre Art in einer Welt, in der Mystik und Technologie kollidieren. Schlüpfen Sie in die Rolle von Kaiserin Emily Kaldwin oder ihres Kaiserlichen Schutzherrn Corvo Attano? Werden Sie sich ungesehen Ihren Weg durch das Spiel bahnen, vollen Gebrauch vom kompromisslosen Kampfsystem machen – oder eine Mischung aus beidem wählen? Wie werden Sie die besonderen Kräfte, Waffen und Hilfsmittel Ihres Charakters kombinieren, um Ihre Gegner auszuschalten? Die Story reagiert auf Ihre Entscheidungen und nimmt verblüffende Wendungen, während Sie die ausgeklügelten Missionen des Spiels angehen.
<h4>Die story:</h4>
Dishonored 2: Das Vermächtnis der Maske spielt 15 Jahre nach dem Tod des Lordregenten und die gefürchtete Rattenseuche ist nur noch Geschichte. Ein unheimlicher Thronräuber hat Kaiserin Emily Kaldwin den Thron entrissen und das Schicksal des Inselreichs hängt in der Schwebe. Als Emily Kaldwin oder Corvo Attano reisen Sie von den legendären Straßen Dunwalls nach Karnaca, eine einst glanzvolle Küstenstadt, wo der Schlüssel zu Emilys Rückkehr auf den Thron verborgen ist. Mit dem Zeichen des Outsiders und mächtigen neuen übernatürlichen Fähigkeiten jagen Sie Ihre Feinde und holen sich zurück, was Ihnen gehört.

<h4>Wichtige Features:</h4>

<ul>
<li><b>Die Assassinen</b><br>
Emily Kaldwin und Corvo Attano vermitteln als Charaktere mit Sprachausgabe ihre eigenen Perspektiven und emotionalen Reaktionen zur Welt und Story. Setzen Sie die besonderen Kräfte, Hilfsmittel und speziell abgestimmten Waffen der beiden Charaktere auf kreative Weise ein, um die Welt zu erforschen – ob Sie sich nun durch die Straßen kämpfen oder über die Dächer schleichen. Es liegt an Ihnen, welche Gegner Sie ausschalten und welche Sie verschonen.<br>
 </li>
<li><b>Übernatürliche Kräfte</b><br>
Fortgeschrittenes Knochenhandwerk und neue Verbesserungs-Bäume erlauben es, Ihre Kräfte auf sehr unterschiedliche Weise anzupassen. Werden Sie zu einem lebendigen Schatten, um sich lautlos an Ihre Ziele heranzuschleichen. Verbinden Sie Gegner, so dass diese ein gemeinsames Schicksal teilen – oder schlagen Sie Feinde in Ihren Bann, um ihren Geist zu beherrschen.<br>
 </li>
<li><b>Eine Phantasievolle Welt</b><br>
Von den schmierigen, rattenverseuchten Straßen Dunwalls zur üppigen Vegetation der exotischen Küste des verfallenden Karnaca tauchen Sie in stilisierte Schauplätze ein, die von Arkanes herausragenden Grafik- und Story-Teams ins Leben gerufen wurden. Die Welt ist ein eigener Charakter für sich – reich an Geschichte, Architektur und vielfältigen Personen. Das wird auch durch einzigartige Missionsschauplätze betont, wie beispielsweise dem von Staubstürmen und sich bekriegenden Fraktionen heimgesuchten Staubbezirk oder das mit beweglichen Wänden, tödlichen Fallen und Aufziehsoldaten ausgestattete Anwesen eines Wahnsinnigen.<br>
 </li>
<li><b>Die Void-engine</b><br>
Dishonored 2: Das Vermächtnis der Maske wird von der neuen Void-Engine, die bei der Rendering-Technologie für einen großen Sprung nach vorne sorgt, auf wunderschöne Weise zum Leben erweckt. Die Void-Engine basiert auf id Tech und wurde von Arkane Studios stark angepasst. Sie ist darauf ausgelegt, herausragende Art Direction zu unterstützen und die leistungsstarke Hardware der derzeitigen Generation vollends auszuschöpfen. Die Void-Engine erlaubt erhebliche Fortschritte bei allen Spielsystemen, dazu gehören eine realistisch reagierende künstliche Intelligenz bei heimlichem Vorgehen und Kämpfen, sowie Licht- und Grafik-Rendering, Story-Präsentation und beeindruckend dichte Stadtumgebungen.</li>

You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way.

You’ll also need to <b>disable cloud saves</b> (as the save folder is shared between the game and the mod). If you’d like to play the default Fallout 4: GOTY Edition again, you’ll need to uninstall the game and the mod, and then reinstall Fallout 4: GOTY Edition.<br><br>

Frostpunk,,"ESRB M, PEGI 16",,"<p>Frostpunk, the newest title from the creators of This War of Mine, is a society survival game where heat means life and every decision comes at a price. In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. You face the task of building the last city on Earth and securing the means necessary for your community to survive.</p>
<h1>THE CITY MUST SURVIVE</h1>
<p>Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the ruler’s time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and present state.
What decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And who will you become in the process?</p>
<h1>MAKE THE LAW</h1>
<p>Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe.</p>
<h1>SHAPE YOUR SOCIETY</h1>
<p>If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Whichever you choose, remember: there’s no turning back.</p>
<h1>WEIGH UP YOUR CHOICES</h1>
<p>Some of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. Leadership can be a burden.</p>
<h1>DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES</h1>
<p>Survival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills.</p>
<h1>EXPLORE THE FROSTLAND</h1>
<p>While New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society’s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands.</p>
<h1>PLAY ENDLESSLY</h1>
<p>Frostpunk Endless Mode grants you unlimited replayability for the game. Play on 8 various maps, with different terrain, weather conditions and challenges to face. We know that different people look for different experiences and that’s why there are 3 modes available. Endurance will be an ultimate test to your building, managing and survival skills in the harshest conditions. Builders, where there is no generator available from the start, which creates a different type of challenge. Serenity which is focused on enjoying the art of building the city itself, without unnecessary pressure.</p>

</a><br><hr><br>In Ghost of a Tale begleitest du eine mutige Bardenmaus namens Tilo auf ihrer gefährlichen Mission, bei der sie den Verliesen von Burg Dieruin entflieht und das Schicksal ihrer wahren Liebe, Merra, aufdeckt. Ghost of a Tale spielt in einer Mittelalterwelt, in der Ratten über alle anderen Geschöpfe herrschen. Es spinnt eine epische und doch vertraute Geschichte, und kombiniert Elemente von klassischen Adventures, Action-Rollenspielen und Erkundung mit einem hochqualitativen Grafikstil, der dich in seinen Bann ziehen wird.<br>
<br>
Ausgerüstet mit Mäusetalenten wie Heimlichkeit, Beweglichkeit und Tarnung – sowie dem Gespür eines Barden für Musik – erkundest du die verfallene Burg von ihren ausgedehnten Wäldern und Ufern bis hin zu den spinnenverseuchten Katakomben, umgehst dabei allerlei Gefahren und deckst ihre uralten Geheimnisse auf. <br>
<br>
Burg Dieruin ist ein gefährlicher Ort für eine kleine Maus und Tilo ist alles andere als ein Krieger. Wenn du tödlichen Gegnern, die auch noch doppelt so groß sind, entgegenblickst, sind List und Gewandtheit deine einzigen Verbündeten. Sprich mit den Bewohnern von Burg Dieruin, mache deine Feinde zu Freunden, und drehe auf deiner Mission, Merra zu finden, jeden Stein um.<br>

Blaze a trail back to the dark heart of the West in Hard West 2.
<br><br>
You are Gin Carter, a notorious outlaw with a reputation as dangerous as the frontier itself.
<br><br>
On the hunt for a big score, you hear talk that the legendary “Ghost Train” is heading your way loaded with federal gold. This is the one.
<br><br>
You swiftly assemble a posse of outlaws, some with guns, others with the kind of supernatural skills that make saloon bars fall silent in a split second.
<br><br>
Night falls and the posse rides out, silhouetted in the spectral light of the moon. Together, you transform the prairie into an ungodly land echoing with gunfire and the screams of the hunted.
<br><br>
But once on board the train, you discover it’s not named the “Ghost Train” for nothing. What follows is the fight of your life through the uncharted badlands of the Hard West, propelled by bullets, witchcraft, and your pursuit of personal salvation at any cost.
<br><br>
Chase down the devil himself and take back what he stole — your soul.

<b>Hell Pie</b> is an obscene 3D platformer that takes bad taste to the next level! The game sees you grab the horns of Nate, the <b>‘Demon of Bad Taste’</b>. He is given the honorable task of gathering the disgusting ingredients for Satan’s infamous birthday pie. To do so, Nate must venture out into the overworld and do whatever it takes to ensure those ingredients are secured in time, or there’ll be hell to pay!
<br>

<br>
Luckily Nate isn’t alone on this quest, his ‘pet’ angel Nugget is there to offer support. Nugget offers his holy insight when needed, but more importantly is chained to Nate, so can be used like a grappling hook or swung around as a weapon. Nate can also equip horns he finds across the world to give him new hellish abilities.
<br>

<br>
Together Nate and Nugget will explore insane environments, meet tons of repugnant characters and witness some truly shocking sights. <b>Hell Pie</b> is a seriously twisted take on the classic mascot platformer, come along for the ride if you think you can stomach it!

Berlin, 9th November 1989: The streets are full of people. After four decades of division, thousands of cars are rolling across the inner-German border. The Wall is finally open!
<br>
 
<br>
At the same time a man disappears in a secret research facility near East Berlin. His goodbye message reaches you too late. You drive back to the office, where the State Security has already destroyed all records of the research project. The complex is deserted and empty.
<br>
 
<br>
The search for Walter takes you deep into the center of the facility - right into the heart of the universe, where time seems to stand still. The dark secret lurks - well hidden - behind the curtain. In the end, it is horrible insights and the questions of responsibility that make you dive deeper and deeper into a strange, surreal yet familiar world.

<br>
Janosik was a legendary Slovak highlander rogue. According to the legend, he robbed nobles and gave the loot to the poor, just like Robin Hood. The game is based on popular legends in which Janosik had special magical items given to him (usually) by witches. Those items gave him superhuman strength, protected him from bullets, or gave him the ability to jump over the trees. In some legends, Janosik fights with supernatural beings. 
<br>

<br>
We took inspiration from the legends both for this game and the upcoming Janosik 2, and highly recommend that you read more about this hero if you enjoyed playing our retro platformer.

<br>

<br>
<b>King of Seas ist ein Action-Rollenspiel, das in einer tödlichen, prozedural generierten Piratenwelt spielt. In einer grausamen Handlung kämpfst du darum, das wiederzuerlangen, was dir genommen wurde und begibst dich auf ein episches Abenteuer in einer fantastischen Welt, voller Schlachten, vergessenen Inseln und Schätzen.

The demand to act fills your mind, but the script pages hold no words.</p>
<p>Your past has helped to mold you into what you are, forced upon you the skills required to hone your craft. That same past has scraped deep furrowing scars into you, not on the outside where the world can see, but in a place buried so deep within that it has become shapeless. You push those memories down but let the experiences drive you into who, or what, you must play.</p>
<p>Darkness surrounds as you stand silently in the spotlight, the only sounds to be heard over your heartbeat are the distant breaking of waves against the hull and the sound of cameras pointed in your direction preserving this moment for eternity.</p>

It's a tactical dungeon management game where you play as the bad guys! You're the Boss of the Dungeons Defending Department and need to protect the company's treasures against pesky heroes! This version of the game contains around 1-2 hours of gameplay and introduces Legend of Keepers mechanics, lore building and game strategy.<h4>Features</h4>

First, you will have to plan your defense against a group of adventurers. Check their stats and resistances, then place the best traps and monsters to defeat them! When you think your dungeon is ready, let the crawl begin!
<br>

<br>
You will then be able to watch those heroes die! It's a reversed dungeon crawler, heroes will move through your dungeon and will trigger the traps you've placed. When a group of adventurers meets a group of monsters you've positioned in your dungeon, a turn-based fight will happen!

"Lovecraft's Untold Stories",,"ESRB T, PEGI 16",," Lovecraft’s Untold Stories ist ein Action-Roguelite mit RPG-Elementen. Sie erkunden zufällig generierte Level, die in H. P. Lovecrafts Geschichten angesiedelt sind, kämpfen gegen Kultisten und diverse aus dem Mythos bekannte Monster, verbessern Ihre Waffen und Ihre Ausrüstung, lösen Rätsel, meistern Herausforderungen und suchen nach Hinweisen und Informationen, um die Großen Alten und die Äußeren Götter zu besiegen.<h4><b>LIVE H.P. LOVECRAFT’S STORIES </b></h4>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/lovecrafts_untold_stories/Hospital3_small.jpg"">

<br>
Lovecraft’s Untold Stories basiert auf den Geschichten von H. P. Lovecraft. Hier können Sie den kosmischen Horror, diese Ausgeburt der Fantasie des Genies aus Providence, hautnah erleben. Jede Spielfigur muss ihre eigenen Ermittlungen anstellen, die sie an die unterschiedlichsten Orte führen werden, von einer unheimlichen alten viktorianischen Villa bis hin zum verlassenen Hospital, in dem verbotene Experimente durchgeführt werden oder in den Dschungel, wo Eingeborenenstämme längst vergessen geglaubte Rituale zelebrieren. Die Level werden nach dem Zufallsprinzip generiert, so wird jedes Spiel garantiert zu einem einzigartigen Erlebnis. Außerdem unterscheiden sie sich je nach der Spielfigur, mit der Sie gerade spielen. Halten Sie nach Gegenständen und Hinweisen Ausschau, um Geheimnisse aufzudecken und neue Geschichten zu finden!

<h4><b>5 SPIELFIGUREN, 5 METHODEN, GEGEN DEN MYTHOS ZU KÄMPFEN </b></h4>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/lovecrafts_untold_stories/LUT-GHOUL.gif"">

<br>
Jeder der 5 Spielcharaktere hat einen individuellen Spielstil und eine eigene Geschichte. Begleiten Sie einen hartgesottenen Privatdetektiv, eine Hexe, eine Diebin, einen Professor oder gar einen Ghoul auf ihrer Reise ins Unbekannte. Jede Spielfigur hat eigene Attribute, Waffen und Kampfstile. So wird jedes neue Spiel zu einem einzigartigen Erlebnis. Der Detektiv hat durchschnittliche Gesundheit und Ausdauer und bietet so einen ausgeglichenen Spielstil. Der Professor spezialisiert sich auf den Distanzkampf, hat weniger Gesundheit und einen besonderen Energieschild, den seine Waffe, der Tillinghast-Apparat, generiert. Die Hexe verursacht sehr viel Schaden, kann teleportieren und setzt zudem Elementarschilde aus Eis und Feuer ein, ihr Vorrat an Lebensenergie ist allerdings sehr begrenzt. Die Diebin ist eine Nahkampfspezialistin, die Tarnung und Täuschung nutzt, um maximalen Schaden zu bewirken. Der Ghoul verursacht im Nahkampf sehr viel Schaden, hat viel Lebensenergie und ist imstande, sich selbst zu heilen, kann jedoch keine Verbandskästen benutzen.

<h4><b>ENTDECKEN SIE DIE GEHEIMNISSE DER GROSSEN ALTEN </b></h4>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/lovecrafts_untold_stories/LUT-WITCH.gif"">

<br>
Die düstere Wahrheit um die Schrecken, die dem Universum innewohnen, ist für den menschlichen Verstand unerträglich. Letzten Endes können Sie gegen die Alten nicht bestehen. Auf Sie warten nur Tod oder Wahnsinn. Doch vielleicht vermögen Sie es, das Unvermeidliche hinauszuzögern ... Wenn Sie den Großen Alten gegenübertreten, ohne das Geringste über sie zu wissen, fallen Sie allein bei ihrem abstoßenden Anblick dem Wahnsinn anheim. Jedoch können Sie, verteilt auf allen Leveln, besondere Gegenstände finden, die Informationen über die Großen Alten enthalten. Je mehr Sie über sie wissen, desto besser ist auch Ihr Verstand gewappnet. Doch Wissen ist nicht leicht zu erlangen! Wenn Sie bei Ihren Ermittlungen nicht gründlich genug vorgehen, könnte es passieren, dass Sie am Ende einer der Geschichten anlangen, ohne alles gefunden zu haben, was es zu wissen gibt. Sie müssen mit jedem der Spielcharaktere spielen, wenn Sie alle Informationen über jeden der Großen Alten finden möchten!

<h4><b>DER WAHNSINN LAUERT  </b></h4>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/lovecrafts_untold_stories/LUT-THIEF.gif"">

<br>
Hinter jeder Ecke lauert der Wahnsinn auf jene, die es wagen, dem Mythos gegenüberzutreten. Im Zuge Ihrer Ermittlungen werden Sie diverse Situationen erleben, in denen Sie sich entscheiden müssen; treffen Sie die falsche Entscheidung, verlieren Sie nach und nach Ihren Verstand. Sie benötigen Wissen, um die Großen Alten im Kampf zu stellen. Um dieses Wissen zu erlangen, müssen Sie Ihre Umgebung erkunden, doch je mehr Nachforschungen Sie anstellen, desto mehr Dingen werden Sie begegnen, die Ihre geistige Gesundheit zu erschüttern vermögen ... Jene, die unter dem Einfluss des Mythos dem Wahnsinn verfallen, nehmen sich das Leben, um dem ewigen Horror zu entgehen, dem sie nun ins Antlitz blicken müssen. Doch noch ist nicht alle Hoffnung verloren, denn es gibt Methoden, geistige Gesundheit zurückzuerlangen ...

<br />
Mido and Di was a short animation project we wrote but couldn't complete nearly 15 years ago. This game is based on that story, but the story is not playing much part in the game. This is a frantic action, third person, zombie shooting game. You play in simplistic, beautiful looking levels, trying to shoot zombie aliens before they got you. The zombie aliens are coming in waves, like a tower defense game but this is a third person look to that mechanic. You have three different weapons and they are very fun to use. Combining ice and fire weapon, you can even get coins out of zombies. With that coins you upgrade weapons.<br />
<br />
If you are interested to read the story of the animation, here it is (and I will write it like a storyboard concept) :<br />
-Mido is having another nightmare. Objects in his room has changed shape and looks very scary.<br />
-He wakes up. It is another school morning. He waits the school bus. When the bus comes camera goes black.<br />
-Mido returns home from school. He goes to his room and throws his bag with anger.<br />
-He draws a creature to a paper and hangs it on his wall. He names it Di.<br />
-He goes to sleep and he is having another nightmare. But this time, his friend Di, rescues him.<br />
-He wakes up. There is rain outside. He is afraid of thunder but he gets close to window. He opens it.<br />

Both game mechanics and history are based on an innovative concept of dynamic topography and issuing orders to individuals with free will.

Take control of your mighty space armada, and wreak havoc across the cosmos, but choose your targets wisely! Conquered planets will net you income to expand your forces, but you must carefully weigh the pros and cons of attacking each planet, as timing and available resources are critical to victory.

You must make tactical decisions at every turn, from scouting your enemies and deploying units, to shoring up your planets’ defenses and knowing when to attack and when to defend. Strategic multi-tasking and a keen military mind will lead directly to unrivaled glory…while careless play will reduce your army to space dust.<br>The Campaign mode tests your military might with 32 thrilling levels, each with varied planets, tasks and game modes. Defend a planet until reinforcements arrive, fly into uncharted space, conquer planets and set up defenses before rivals attack - the list goes on and on, as there is no shortage of objectives in your struggle for interstellar dominance.

If you've got some friends over and are looking for something to play, <i>Polyball's</i> splitscreen multiplayer promises a good time.

Steam Workshop gives the players a voice, allowing for the mechanics and level designs of Polyball to stretch far beyond what we had initially put into the game. With a built-in level editor easily accessible from the main menu creating content is a breeze, it even supports custom model and texture importing!<h2 class=""bb_tag"">A BIT ABOUT US</h2>The first full release from digital design practice Studio Monolith, Polyball is an experiment in low-poly visuals and open-ended game design. Our approach with the project was to make the kind of game we used to play, something that had both casual appeal and a limitless competitive ceiling. It was also a genre that we felt hasn't been adequately adapted to the modern world of game design. Our vision was simple: build a game that's easy to pick up, hard to master, and fun both on and off screen.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">FEATURES</h2><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li> 60+ levels and free DLC<br></li><li> Powerful customization system<br></li><li> Full controller support and keybinding<br></li><li> Splitscreen multiplayer support<br></li><li> Global/Friends Leaderboards<br></li><li> Full soundtrack made by independent artists<br></li><li> Steam Workshop<br></li><li> Tuned mechanics and balanced levels based on community feedback<br></li><li> Mac/Windows/Linux support<br></li><li> Alternate language localization<br></li><li> Ghosts<br></li><li> Steam Cloud Saves<br></li><li> Level editor with custom model support<br></li><li> Stats display<br></li><li> Achievements </li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">MULTIPLAYER MODES</h2><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li> Trails<br></li><li> Battle<br></li><li> Split-Screen + Online Story Mode<br></li><li> More modes coming soon!</li></ul>",Studio Monolith,Studio Monolith,False,False,"Co-Operative, Multiplayer, Single Player",368180,"Indie, Platform, Racing, Simulator",,False,4 Jun 2015,18 Apr 2020 00:00:00,,21 Jul 2022 23:05:13,18 Apr 2020 00:00:00,,Not Played,"Steam:https://store.steampowered.com/app/368180, Official Website:http://polyball.studiomonolith.ca, Twitter:https://twitter.com/studio_monolith",,,PC (Windows),0,0,cb91dfc9-b977-43bf-8e70-55f46e410fab,Steam,,,,80,90,,,1cc8c701-5580-49e7-833c-2730da11ca82

With changing environments as dangerous as they are dynamic, the Mooncrash campaign for Prey will offer a fun, infinitely replayable challenge to test even the most skilled players.</p>
<h2>Story</h2>
<p>In Prey: Mooncrash, TranStar’s secret moon base stopped transmitting shortly after the events of Prey.

Prey is about choices, and those choices belong to you.</p>
<h2>Search for Secrets, Loot…and a Way Off</h2>
<p>Arkane Studios’ talent for detail and story-rich environments comes alive in Mooncrash. As you explore the station, which is the same size and scope of four levels of the original game’s Talos I station, don’t forget to keep your eyes peeled for precious supplies – and, of course, Mimics.</p>
<h2>New Challenges, New Solutions</h2>
<p>The Typhon threat has returned with familiar foes and tough new enemies, each armed with a unique set of deadly characteristics. Use the full power of the arsenal at your disposal, including popular weapons and abilities from Prey’s main game, to fight for your life and make a mad dash for your escape.</p>

Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time,,"ESRB T, GRAC 18, PEGI 12",,"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a third-person puzzle-platformer and action-adventure computer and video game published by Ubisoft. It was released on November 21, 2003 and is a reboot of the landmark video game series Prince of Persia, created by Jordan Mechner in 1989.
<br>
<br>The Sands of Time, developed internally at Ubisoft Montreal, successfully captures the mechanics of the original platformer and extends it to the 3D generation. An earlier attempt by The Learning Company to transfer the game to 3D (Prince of Persia 3D) was released in 1999, but despite its initial good reception failed to sell enough and the company responsible for the original trilogy was already closing doors. The game was praised for its visual design, finely tuned game mechanics and intriguing storyline, winning the game several awards.
<br>
<br>The game was developed for the PC, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, and later a 2D-version for the Game Boy Advance and mobile phones. The success of The Sands of Time led to three followups, Prince of Persia: Warrior Within (2004), Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones (2005), and Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands (2010). A remastered, high-definition, version of The Sands of Time was released on the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 on November 16, 2010.",Ubisoft Montreal,"Nintendo, Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc.

With the fleet trapped around Stroggos, only 5% of ground forces surviving, and that number dwindling by the second, your orders have changed: free your comrades and destroy the Gravity Well.

Much more than just a sequel, this second coming has a mind (and an engine) of its own. Fifty-five larger mission-based levels, including 64-player DeathMatch and Capture the Flag levels.

<p>Prepare your ears for one of the most intense dynamic soundtracks you have ever heard. Redout enhances your experience and transcends visuals, immersing yourself in a mixture of sounds and music that adapts to your playstyle and your performance on the track.</p>
<h1>Handling</h1>
<p>Control is the most important feeling when you are racing at 800km/h. Redout features believable physics derived from quad-copters controllers and real magnetic forces. We came up with the next generation in AG handling. There's always a way to face a corner without braking, but you have to prepare for it and use everything you've got. Steer, strafe and turbo out of a corner are the basics: upgrades and powerups will grant you even more control on your ship's behaviour. You'll need to dominate your ship before you face the advanced tracks.</p>

Scorn,,PEGI 18,,"<i>Scorn</i> is an atmospheric first-person horror adventure game set in a nightmarish universe of odd forms and somber tapestry.
<br>

<br>
It is designed around the idea of ""being thrown into the world"". Isolated and lost inside this dream-like world, you will explore different interconnected regions in a non-linear fashion. The unsettling environment is a character itself.
<br>

<br>
Every location contains its own theme (story), puzzles and characters that are integral in creating a cohesive world. Throughout the game you will open up new areas, acquire different skill sets, weapons, various items and try to comprehend the sights presented to you.<h4>GAMEPLAY FEATURES</h4>

But keep your eyes open - the game won’t show you any sympathy if you miss something important on your uneasy travels.

Der eine Ort, den ein Meisterdieb wie Teriel unbedingt meiden würde, ist zweifelsohne die Gefängnisinsel Peh. Doch nachdem ein gewagter Raubüberfall eine unerwartete Wendung nimmt, findet sich Teriel gefesselt auf einem Luftschiff wieder, das auf dem Weg zu eben dieser berüchtigten Insel ist. Schlimmer noch: Der Dämon in seinem Kopf lässt keinen Zweifel daran, dass er nie entkommen wird, wenn er seinen Befehlen nicht genau folgt.<br><br>

Du spielst in Seven: The Days Long Gone als Teriel. Du musst deine gesamte List einsetzen und im Verborgenen bleiben, um aus einem Netz der Täuschung und des Verrats zu entrinnen und die Insel Peh letztlich zu überleben.

Du kannst dich umsehen, wo du willst – lediglich Kontrollpunkte, monsterverseuchte Bereiche und gefährliche Fraktionen halten dich davon ab!
<b><h4>WÄHLE DEINEN SPIELSTIL</b></h4>  Als Meisterdieb weiß Teriel, wie man im Verborgenen agiert. Überrumple Gegner von hinten und von oben, führ sie mit listigen Verkleidungen auf den Leim oder nutze die Umgebung, um ganz unbemerkt zu bleiben. Wenn jedoch etwas schief- oder dir die Geduld ausgeht, hält dich nichts davon ab, eine Reihe verheerender Waffen und tödliche Magiefähigkeiten auf deine Feinde loszulassen.
<b><h4>LERNE ZAHLREICHE VIELFÄLTIGE CHARAKTERE KENNEN</b></h4>  Du triffst auf eine Menge Leute, von verzweifelten Sklaven und Gefangenen bis hin zu den Reichen und Schönen. Beachte dabei nur die zwei wichtigen Fraktionen auf Peh: die Biomancers und die Technomagi. An so einem Ort der Verzweiflung gibt es viele, die alle Hilfe in Anspruch nehmen, die sie kriegen können. Entscheide dich, ob du den Bewohnern Pehs helfen oder sie ausnutzen willst, aber denk daran, dass es in jedem Fall Konsequenzen gibt.

<p>Shadow Tactics is a hardcore tactical stealth game set in Japan around the Edo period</p>
<p>Take control of a team of deadly specialists and sneak in the shadows between dozens of enemies. Choose your approach when infiltrating mighty castles, snowy monasteries or hidden camps. Set traps, poison your opponents or completely avoid enemy contact.</p>
<p>The group is composed of very different personalities</p>
<p>Working together as a team seems impossible at first. Yet over the course of many missions, trust is won and friendships are made. The characters develop their own dynamic and each member will have to face their own personal demons.</p>

<b>Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director’s Cut Features:</b>
<br><br>
<b>A Classic, Story-Driven cRPG</b>: See why PC Gamer hailed Dragonfall as “one of the most memorable and complex RPG stories of the decade.” Dragonfall hearkens back to the golden age of computer RPG’s with a novel-like branching narrative full of sharp prose and deep character development. Immerse yourself in a smart, 20+ hour campaign with a diverse cast of all-too-human characters.
<br><br>
<b>A One-of-a-Kind Cyberpunk Setting</b>: Experience the unique “Tech meets Magic” dystopian future of Shadowrun, a fan-favorite game setting now celebrating it’s 25th anniversary. Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director’s Cut is the perfect entry point to the setting for those with no prior Shadowrun experience, while providing plenty of classic Shadowrun characters and tech for veteran players to sink their teeth into.
<br><br>
<b>Command Your Team</b>: Lead a small team of shadowrunners - each with their own outlook, motivations, and backstory. The members of your team are designed to play contrasting roles during missions, and each has a distinct set of skills, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. But it’s not all about the mission - each team member also has challenges to face in their own lives, which you can choose to brush aside or play an important part in.
<br><br>
<b>Gripping, Turn-Based Tactical Combat</b>: When you’re running the shadows, every turn matters. Choose your actions wisely - move to better cover, charge into melee, or lob a fireball into a crowd of enemies. With over 200 weapons and spells at your disposal, every turn is filled with meaningful choices.
<br><br>
<b>Skill-Based Character Progression</b>: Choose a starting character archetype and build from there! Street Samurai and Physical Adepts use advanced combat skills to dominate the battlefield, Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells, while Riggers and Deckers provide critical technological support, projecting their consciousness directly into drones and computer systems. Shadowrun: Dragonfall’s classless skill system allows you to grow your character in any direction you choose.
<br><br>
<b>New in the Director’s Cut:</b>
<br><br>
<b>Standalone</b>: Due to popular demand, Dragonfall is now a completely standalone title!
<br><br>
<b>Five All-New Missions</b>: The Director’s Cut features five all-new original missions, including three related directly to the personal stories of your team members. These missions take you to previously-unseen locales - both within the Flux State and beyond - where you’ll have to face challenging enemies and make tough choices in order to help your team members prevail.
<br><br>
<b>Revamped Combat System</b>: The Dragonfall combat system has received a major overhaul. An all-new armor system adds another tactical layer to the experience, while refined cover and damage mechanics emphasize the importance of battlefield positioning. Complementing these improvements is an upgraded AI system which reacts more intelligently and accurately to your actions.
<br><br>
Redesigned Interface: The Dragonfall in-game interface has also been rebuilt. Spells, items and abilities are now much easier to access, while improved combat feedback allows you to fully understand the tactical situation in any given encounter.
<br><br>
<b>Customize Your Team</b>: Guide your team members as they progress in each of their unique roles, choosing between different focus options to grant them new items and abilities. In addition, if you don’t like a team member’s default spell, item or weapon loadout, you can now customize what they bring on each mission.
<br><br>
<b>Ten New Pieces of Original Music</b>: Fan-favorite composer Jon Everist brings ten new tracks of moody cyberpunk music to the Dragonfall experience, including compositions based on the stories of individual members of your team.
<br><br>
<b>The Complete Dragonfall Soundtrack</b>: As a free bonus, the Director’s Cut includes the entire soundtracks from both Dragonfall AND our previous title, Shadowrun Returns. This also includes the brand new tracks exclusive to the Director’s Cut. Featuring music from the composers of the classic Shadowrun SEGA and SNES games, this exciting cyberpunk soundtrack pays homage to the past with a modern sentiment.

You simply enjoy your small victory in this, the harshest of times.</p>

Given a head-start over the billions lost in a nuclear holocaust, you must gather as many supplies as possible en route to the concrete underground shelter that will soon become your family home for the foreseeable dreary future.</p>

<p><strong>London, 1888.</strong> After a decade of war with the Lunar invaders we named the Selenites, the British Empire finally vanquished the insect-like menace thanks to a dashing officer by the name of Hugo Wells. He crushed the colony’s queen and in doing so cemented his status as both a hero of the empire, and the de facto patriarch of the drone-like Selenites.</p>
<p>Following the war, the Selenites became the new workforce of our industrial revolution, ushering in a new era of progress and prosperity. Freed from the shackles of employment, man could pursue more earthly endeavors. However, listlessness and disobedience rampaged throughout the middle and working classes. In order to satiate the masses, Hugo Wells conceived of the ultimate entertainment. An elite sport where only the bravest, the fastest and the most worthy warriors could wage a petty war against the enslaved Selenite hordes. Welcome… to Speed Brawl!</p>

STAR WARS Jedi: Fallen Order,,"CERO C, ESRB T, PEGI 16",,"A galaxy-spanning adventure awaits in <i>Star Wars</i> Jedi: Fallen Order™, a new third-person action-adventure title from Respawn Entertainment. This narratively-driven, single-player game puts you in the role of a Jedi Padawan who narrowly escaped the purge of Order 66 following the events of <i>Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith</i>. On a quest to rebuild the Jedi Order, you must pick up the pieces of your shattered past to complete your training, develop new powerful Force abilities and master the art of the iconic lightsaber – all while staying one step ahead of the Empire and its deadly Inquisitors. 
<br>
<br>
While mastering your abilities, players will engage in cinematically-charged lightsaber and Force combat designed to deliver the kind of intense <i>Star Wars</i> lightsaber battles as seen in the films. Players will need to approach enemies strategically, sizing up strengths and weaknesses while cleverly utilizing your Jedi training to overcome your opponents and solve the mysteries that lay in your path. 
<br>
<br>
<i>Star Wars</i> fans will recognize iconic locations, weapons, gear, and enemies while also meeting a roster of fresh characters, creatures, droids and adversaries. As part of this authentic <i>Star Wars</i> story, fans will delve into a galaxy recently seized by the Empire. As a Jedi hero-turned-fugitive, players will need to fight for survival while exploring the mysteries of a long-extinct civilization all in an effort to rebuild the remnants of the Jedi Order as the Empire seeks to erase them completely.
<br>
<br>
KEY FEATURES
<br>
<br>
●<b>Cinematic, Immersive Combat</b> – Jedi: Fallen Order delivers the fantasy of becoming a Jedi through its innovative lightsaber combat system – striking, parrying, dodging – partnered with a suite of powerful Force abilities you’ll need to leverage to overcome obstacles that stand in your way. This combat system is intuitive to pick up but takes training and practice to fully master its nuances as you gain new powers and abilities along your adventure.
<br>
<br>
●<b>A New Jedi Story Begins</b> – As a former Padawan on the run from the Empire, you must complete your training before Imperial Inquisitors discover your plan to revive the Jedi Order. Aided by a former Jedi Knight, a cantankerous pilot and a fearless droid, you must escape the evil machinations of the Empire in a story-driven adventure. Explore and overcome a wide range of challenges focused on combat, exploration and puzzle-solving.
<br>
<br>
●<b>The Galaxy Awaits</b> – Ancient forests, windswept rock faces and haunted jungles are all unique biomes you’ll explore in Jedi: Fallen Order, with the freedom to decide when and where you go next. As you unlock new powers and abilities, opportunities open up to re-traverse maps in new ways, leveraging the Force to augment the way you explore. Move quickly, however, as the Empire is actively hunting your every step in their effort to exterminate all remnants of the Jedi Order.

Dein Motorrad ist deine Waffe, mit der du deine Gegner auf fantastische, stylishe Weise zu Altmetall verarbeiten kannst, während du hoch, runter, links und rechts über Dächer und durch von Gegnern besetzte Tunnel heist.<h4><h4><b>Inhalte</b></h4></h4><h4><i>Rasen, schießen, Stunts – alles im Preis inbegriffen!</i></h4><img src=""https://items.gog.com/steel_rats/ride_Shoot_stunt_final.gif"" >
<br>
Mal was ganz anderes: Steel Rats™ vereint Genres auf ganz neue Weise und kombiniert 2,5-D-Stunts mit Rennaction, Platforming-Elementen und spannendem Fahrzeugkampf.<h4><i>Fahren und zerstören!</i></h4><img src=""https://items.gog.com/steel_rats/drive_and_Destroy_final.gif"" >
<br>
Dein Motorrad ist deine Waffe im Kampf gegen einfallende, außerirdische Schrottboter. Kombiniere Nahkampf und präzises Schießen mit einem irren Waffenarsenal für dein Bike – inklusive an den Rädern montierte Sägeblätter, Harpunen und Feuer speiende Auspuffrohre. Du wirst sicher ein paar interessante Einsatzmöglichkeiten für diese Werkzeuge finden, um deinen Gegnern den Garaus zu machen.<h4><i>Immer mit Stil
</i></h4><img src=""https://items.gog.com/steel_rats/Ride_with_Style_final.gif"" >
<br>
Lass den Motor an und meistere die realistische, physikbasierte Steuerung deines Motorrads, um Stunts auszuführen und die Schrottboter mit Spezialfähigkeiten und besonderen Waffen zu vernichten. Je kreativer du bei deinen Zerstörungsaktionen bist, desto besser: Fahre Wände hoch, schlage Rückwärtssaltos an Gebäudewänden und lasse Chaos hinabregnen, während du über Kopf fährst.<h4><i>Boosten und erkunden</i></h4><img src=""https://items.gog.com/steel_rats/dashandexplore.gif"" >
<br>
Entdecke die Geheimnisse von Coastal City und finde heraus, was es mit der Invasion der Schrottboter auf sich hat. Erkunde jeden Level, finde Sammelgegenstände, schalte neue Gegenden frei und kämpfe dich an die Spitze der Bestenliste.<h4><i>Triff die Gang!</i></h4><img src=""https://items.gog.com/steel_rats/Meet_the_gang_gif.gif"" >
<br>
Entscheide dich, als welches der vier „Steel Rats“-Mitglieder du spielen willst und wechsle jederzeit zwischen ihnen. Jeder Charakter hat eine einzigartige Fähigkeit sowie eine besondere Waffe an ihrem individuell modifizierten Motorrad. So bist du jederzeit bereit, die Schrottboter zu zerlegen!

<br>
In a modern fantasy world, college dropout Grace is granted the power of a Muse - power she’ll need to find out the truth behind her predecessor’s death before time runs out. You’ll decide who Grace allies with, who she can trust, and who may betray her in this beautifully hand-illustrated roleplaying musical.
<br>

<br>
Written by David Gaider comes Stray Gods - an urban fantasy tale of finding your place, taking charge of your fate, and discovering answers. Your choices will change the endings, as well as the path you take to get there.

Fully orchestrated and performed by an all-star cast, you’ll feel as though you’re right there on the stage.

<h1>Scavenge, Craft, and Survive</h1>
<p>After crash landing in your Life Pod, the clock is ticking to ﬁnd water, food, and to develop the equipment you need to explore. Collect resources from the ocean around you. Craft diving gear, lights, habitat modules, and submersibles.</p>

<h1>Construct Underwater Habitats</h1>
<p>Build bases on the sea ﬂoor. Choose layouts and components, and manage hull-integrity as depth and pressure increase. Use your base to store resources, park vehicles, and replenish oxygen supplies as you explore the vast ocean.</p>

<h1>Unravel the Mystery</h1>
<p>What happened to this planet? Signs abound that something is not right. What caused you to crash? What is infecting the sea life? Who built the mysterious structures scattered around the ocean? Can you ﬁnd a way to make it oﬀ the planet alive?</p>

<p>As the sun goes down, the predators come out. Areas that are safe to explore during the day become treacherous at night, but also reveal a beauty that those who hide from the darkness will never see.</p>

Super Meat Boy Forever,,PEGI 12,,"Meat Boy and Bandage Girl have grown as a couple since 2010. It seems like only yesterday the two love birds were escaping from an exploding laboratory in the sky. Now it’s the current year, and they’ve welcomed their daughter Nugget into the world. Their peaceful days enjoying life as a family came to an abrupt end when Dr. Fetus beat the snot out of them with a rusty shovel, and kidnapped Nugget! Now it’s up to Meat Boy and Bandage Girl to rescue their daughter from a lunatic fetus in a jar that can only be described as an incel version of Tony Stark.
<br>
<br>- Super Meat Boy Forever is the sequel to Super Meat Boy! This is a new experience that eclipses the original. Don’t stare directly at it unless you still have your eclipse glasses.
<br>- 7200 individually handcrafted levels combine dynamically to give you a new challenge every single time you play. Seven thousand two hundred levels. They said we couldn’t do it, but we did. Who’s they? Don’t ask. They don’t like it when you ask.
<br>- It’s hard, but fair. Nothing in life worth having comes easy. Just ask Dark Soulman.
<br>- Meat Boy and Bandage Girl can fight back. It’s time to unleash the raw fury of parenthood on their foes just like Liam Neeson in that documentary about his family vacation in Paris.
<br>- Bigger boss battles than before. Your mind will be blown. Your socks will be blown off. Team Meat is not liable for any of this.
<br>- Brand new art with stunning detail and resolution. There are a lot of pixels in here. Grab the biggest display you have and watch those dots change color rapidly with gumption. Don’t sit too close though. (If your parents aren’t home you can sit as close as you want we won’t tell, but Team Meat is still not liable for any of this.)

Syndicate Plus,,ESRB T,,"In the dark and twisted cities of tomorrow, corporate syndicates compete for global dominance. But the boardroom deals and corporate takeovers of the future look very different from today: they are lead by marketing directors who manage teams of half-men, half-machine cyborgs with no conscience and plenty of guns.
<br><br>
You are an ambitious marketing director in the Syndicate, hand-picked to lead a team of cyborg mercenaries. You work in the problem-solving department and you are damn good at ""taking care"" of problems. Some might say that violence is not the answer but you know better. There here are hardly any problems that you can't solve with a well-placed bullet. Collateral damage in the local population and infrastructure during the “negotiations” is, as always, acceptable. After all, what would you expect form the dystopian futuristic world run by mega-corporations?
<br><br>
Syndicate is Bullfrog’s masterpiece of a game in which you aren’t saving the world or protecting innocents. You just make sure that your employers get what they want. At your disposal are four cyborg agents, an impressive arsenal of weapons and gadgets, and a massive selection of cybernetic upgrades. You are free to unleash this power on a highly interactive map where you can blow up buildings, steal cars, light trees on fire, or just shoot stuff. Produced by Peter Molyneux himself, Syndicate is the essence of cyberpunk and, with its great music, stylized visuals, and mind-blowing atmosphere, it has earned its place among the best games of all time. Make sure to check out the game that secured Bullfrog's place in game development hall of fame.

Terroir,,,,"Terroir ist eine Wirtschaftssimulation mit isometrischer Hexfeld-Grafik, bei der Sie Ihr ganz eigenes Weingut managen. Sie bauen Trauben verschiedener Sorten an, kreieren Ihre eigenen Weine, verwalten Ihr Gut und bauen es nach und nach weiter aus. Dabei müssen Sie Faktoren wie das Wetter und andere zufällige Ereignisse berücksichtigen und Ihren Betrieb entsprechend einstellen.<h4>Features</h4>
Zu den Features und Spielmechaniken zählen:
<br>

<br>
<ul class=""bb_ul""><li> Große Auswahl verschiedener Rebsorten, die jeweils unterschiedliche Ansprüche stellen.
<br>
</li><li> Dynamisches Wettersystem, welches das unberechenbare Wetter in der realen Welt simuliert.
<br>
</li><li> Jeder vollständige Durchgang umfasst 60 Jahre im Spiel, doch Sie können auch dann noch weiterspielen, ohne allerdings zusätzliche Punkte zu sammeln.
<br>
</li><li> Erschaffen Sie Ihre eigenen Wein-Kreationen in vier klassischen Schritten: Keltern, Gärung, Maischen und Reifung.  Jede Rebsorte muss auf eine ganz bestimmte Art und Weise hergestellt werden, um die besten Ergebnisse zu erzielen, weshalb Sie jede davon erlernen und meistern müssen.
<br>
</li><li> Sie fangen das Spiel mit einem einzigen Hexfeld für den Anbau an und erweitern Ihr Weingut dann auf bis zu 33 Hexfelder, wobei sechs verschiedene Typen zur Auswahl stehen. Manche Felder beeinflussen die Felder in ihrer Umgebung, weshalb eine strategische Planung unerlässlich ist.
<br>
</li><li> Und natürlich können Sie Ihr Weingut mit Deko-Objekten noch verschönern.
<br>
</li><li> ZUFALL & RISIKO: Zufallsereignisse und Missionen bei Terroir. Sie können die Wunderkiste öffnen und sich zwischen ZUFALL (einem Zufallsereignis mit positiven oder negativen Folgen) und RISIKO (einer Mission, für deren Abschluss es eine Belohnung gibt, Versagen aber mit einer Strafe geahndet wird) entscheiden.
<br>
</li><li> Treten Sie bei Wettbewerben an, um den Marktwert Ihres Weines und den Ruf Ihres Weinguts zu verbessern.
<br>
</li><li> Klares, minimalistisches Design und wunderschöne 3-D-Modelle im Low-Poly-Look.
<br>
</li><li> Original-Soundtrack komponiert und eingespielt vom CLARQuinet-Ensemble aus Singapur.</li></ul>
<br>
Also, nichts wie los, ziehen Sie Ihre Handschuhe an, schnappen Sie sich Ihre Gartenschere und bauen Sie von Grund auf Ihr eigenes Chateau. Viel Glück, Prost und zum Wohl!

<h3>Run & Hide</h3>
With no escape in sight, Youngho must roam the halls of his school at night searching for a way out. During this journey he will encounter many threats hell-bent on killing him. Running is the best way to avoid danger — unfortunately, Youngho isn't much of an athlete, so he can't run forever. Find a place to hide and keep your mouth shut!
<br><br>
<h3>Explore</h3>
The Coma is a harsh world. This twisted reality of your high school knows no kindness. Use maps, notes, and tips from other characters to navigate your way through the world and figure out how you became trapped in such a bleak place.
<br><br>
<h3>Survive & Escape</h3>
Everything is out to get you. Youngho will have to avoid a persistent killer, lashing tentacles, and more to survive the school. Unfortunately, health is in short supply, and if you're not careful, you will die. The good news is that save-points provide a welcome breather from the onslaught of things trying to kill you.
<br><br>
<h3>Korean Horror</h3>
The Coma provides a glimpse — albeit a horrific one — into the life of Korea's overworked high school students. We hope you'll enjoy our infusion of Korean culture into the survival horror genre.
<br><br>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
As Youngho, you must navigate through the three connected buildings of your high school using your wits. Along the way, you will find unlockable art, notes, and easter eggs that expand on The Coma universe. Oh yeah, did we mention the relentless killer, traps, and inevitable game overs?

<br><br>
After spending all night studying for the last day of Sehwa High’s final exams, Youngho has an eerie dream. He arrives at school the next morning and learns someone tried to commit suicide in school the night before. Despite this, class goes on!
<br><br>
Youngho drifts asleep during the final to find himself trapped in the school at night. The only problem is...he’s not alone. You can run. You can hide. Can you survive while piecing together the nightmarish mystery of Sehwa High?

The Outer Worlds is an award-winning single-player first-person sci-fi RPG from Obsidian Entertainment and Private Division. 
<br>

<br>
Lost in transit while on a colonist ship bound for the furthest edge of the galaxy, you awake decades later only to find yourself in the midst of a deep conspiracy threatening to destroy the Halcyon colony. As you explore the furthest reaches of space and encounter various factions, all vying for power, the character you decide to become will determine how this player-driven story unfolds. In the corporate equation for the colony, you are the unplanned variable. 

<br>
<h3>KEY FEATURES</h3>

<h4>The player-driven story RPG</h4>In keeping with the Obsidian tradition, how you approach The Outer Worlds is up to you. Your choices affect not only the way the story develops; but your character build, companion stories, and end game scenarios.

<br>

<h4>You can be flawed, in a good way</h4>
New to The Outer Worlds is the idea of flaws. A compelling hero is made by the flaws they carry with them. While playing The Outer Worlds, the game tracks your experience to find what you aren't particularly good at. Keep getting attacked by Raptidons? Taking the Raptiphobia flaw gives you a debuff when confronting the vicious creatures, but rewards you with an additional character perk immediately. This optional approach to the game helps you build the character you want while exploring Halcyon.

<h4>Lead your companions</h4>During your journey through the furthest colony, you will meet a host of characters who will want to join your crew. Armed with unique abilities, these companions all have their own missions, motivations, and ideals. It's up to you to help them achieve their goals, or turn them to your own ends.

<h4>Explore the corporate colony</h4>Halcyon is a colony at the edge of the galaxy owned and operated by a corporate board. They control everything... except for the alien monsters left behind when the terraforming of the colony’s two planets didn’t exactly go according to plan. Find your ship, build your crew, and explore the settlements, space stations, and other intriguing locations throughout Halcyon.

<b>The Talos Principle: Road to Gehenna</b> follows the narrative of Uriel, Elohim's messenger, as he explores a strange, hidden part of the simulation on a mission of mercy and redemption in an attempt to free the souls of the damned at all costs.<br>

This substantial expansion consists of four episodes that take experienced players through some of the most advanced and challenging puzzles yet. The Talos Principle writers Tom Jubert and Jonas Kyratzes have returned to pen the expansion and show players an entirely different side of Elohim's world through a journey to Gehenna filled with new characters and a new society with its own history and philosophy.

Serious Sam voice has been recorded by longtime Serious Sam voice actor John J. Dick.<br>

It has been a long road. However, all stories must come to an end.<br><br>

This War of Mine has been giving you a thrilling experience of living through the war as a civilian for five years since its release. Numerous updates and expansions have broadened the experience and filled it with more shades and tonalities of hard civilian existence during wartime. Now, honoring the 5th anniversary of the original release, 11 bit studios proudly presents to you This War of Mine: Final Cut.
<br><br>
This War of Mine: Final Cut contains all the updates and free expansions released so far and introduces not only a new scenario but also expands all scenarios with the locations known from Stories DLCs - even if you don’t own those. In short words - that means you can now experience lots of never-seen-before playthroughs and struggle with new challenges.
<br><br>
<b>Major changes and new content:</b>
<ul>
<li>One new classic scenario</li>
<li>All locations from TWoM Stories added to the original game</li>
<li>New quests and Events on Stories locations</li>

<h4>About This War Of Mine:</h4>

In This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle.
<br><br>
The pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive.
<br><br>
Make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better.

<h4>This War of Mine - main features:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Inspired by real-life events</li>
<li>Control your survivors and manage your shelter</li>
<li>Craft weapons, alcohol, beds or stoves – anything that helps you survive</li>
<li>Make decisions - an often unforgiving and emotionally difficult experience</li>
<li>Randomized world and characters every time you start a new game</li>
<li>Charcoal-stylized aesthetics to complement the game's theme</li>

Treasure Adventure Game,,,,"This game was clearly made with passion. You can see the proof of this almost everywhere. The 2D environments are colorful and enchanting, gameplay feels smooth and polished, not to mention the absolutely huge and very diversified world in which you can spend many hours just exploring. Treasure Adventure Game casts you in the role of a young boy who lands on an island that is a fragment of what was once a continent, destroyed in the war between a demon and a wizard. You accept quests, travel across the oceans, and generally have a bang-up time of being a little boy in a big world, out there looking for treasure and adventure. Your equipment consists of a hat, a parrot, and a boat that appears whenever you touch water. Combine those with the basic platforming abilities like jumping and crawling that you’re familiar with from every platforming game ever, and you’ve got the basics of a phenomenal romp across a huge world filled with treasure, maps, secrets, danger, and triumph.
<br><br>
The music changes with the environments and day-night cycles, enhancing the feel the game is evoking and making you feel immersed in the world as you travel through it. The game has a retro feel, yes, but you really have to see it for yourself to understand what Treasure Adventure Game brings to the table. Since it’s free, of course, there is simply no reason not to!

<i><b>»Trüberbrook« is a thrilling mystery-sci-fi adventure game.</b></i> 
<br>
Enjoy an adventurous vacation to a 1960's parallel universe! A Sci-Fi-Mystery Adventure Game with handmade scenery.
<br>

<br>
Imagine yourself on a vacation to Europe in the late sixties. Now, picture yourself as a young American scientist; Hans Tannhauser. Yes, that's your name in this scenario. While you're at it, think of Trüberbrook, a remote village in rural, mountain-sloped and densely forested cold-war Germany. Because, that's where you somehow end up after hitting the continent. But who cares, you won the trip in a lottery! Or at least, that’s how it seems. But don't fear, instead of getting some rest, you could find yourself having to save the world …

<img src=""https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/en/story.png"">

<br>
<b>The year is 1967.</b> The world policy is dominated by the Cold War and Vietnam, Russia and America are racing to the moon. At the same time in Europe, students take to the streets from Paris to Berlin.
<br>

<br>
On a larger scale, the world is locked in turmoil, but most people are unaware of the events unfolding in an overlooked, sleepy part in the German province. <b>Hans Tannhauser</b>, an American student in his late twenties is caught by surprise: Out of the blue, he wins a trip to a small, German village, <b>Trüberbrook</b>. Truber-what? No idea! It doesn’t help he can’t remember taking part in any lottery in the first place … Happy to put some distance between him and his Ph.D. in quantum physics, he makes his way to Trüberbrook, Germany, bursting with curiosity.
<br>

<br>
But shortly after his arrival, inexplicable things start to happen: A mysterious stranger breaks into his room at the Guesthouse Waldeslust and steals a paper on physics. But who would do that? And why?
<br>

<br>
Gradually, he gets to know the various villagers and spa guests, one more peculiar than the other. Only young anthropologist Greta Lemke, who is on a research trip to Trüberbrook, seems normal to him. Before he knows it, Greta becomes Tannhauser’s accomplice on the <b>adventure of a lifetime</b>! It slowly dawns on the aspiring physicist that his presence in Tüberbrook is not accidental – he is here to save the world!
<br>

<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/en/characters.png"">

<br>
As the story proceeds, Tannhauser teams up with <b>Greta Lemke</b>, a student of paleoanthropology, and bumps into the enigmatic inventor <b>Lazarus Taft</b>.
<br>

<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/tb_tannhauser.png"">

<br>
<b>Hans Tannhauser</b> is an American physics student in his mid-twenties – and a clever one at that. The adorable little fellow is well-read, always curious and of a deeply friendly nature.
<br>

<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/tb_gretchen.png"">

<br>
<b>Greta Lemke</b> was always the fiercest kid in the sandbox; cute but merciless if someone dared interrupting her excavations of twig bones and toy artefacts. The somewhat overenthusiastic student of paleoanthropology arrives in Trüberbrook on an adventure to unravel the mysteries surrounding the village.
<br>

<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/tb_taft.png"">

<br>
As much a reclusive inventor as it gets, <b>Lazarus Taft</b> quickly became talk of the town due to his superior card playing. There must be a reason he bought this costly old mansion in Trüberbrook, of all places … What's up with Lazarus Taft?
<br>

<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/tb_ensemble.png"">

<br>
Trüberbrook is full of quirky villagers, tourists and strangers – like the gruffy but warm-hearted innkeeper Trude or her daughter Leni, ""the weird kid"" from Trüberbrook Elementary. And there's the old baron, a veteran of two world wars, or Lessing, the prototype of modern day conspiracists. And of course Trübi, the legendary lake monster. To name a few.
<br>

<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/en/handcrafted-scenery.png"">

<br>
One of the most distinctive features of the game is the unique visual style. The sceneries are purely handmade. 'Handmade' as in: 'Manufactured using real hands!' And fingers!
<br>

<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/gif_1.jpg"">

<br>
Not the most efficient way of doing things, but certainly the most inefficient one. We're loving it, though! Look at what we do here, piece by piece, by the sweat of our brows. Every little detail is custom-made.
<br>

<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/gif_4.jpg"">

<br>
The models are digitized using a technique called photogrammetry and later retopologized. This way we get highly detailed polygon models that blend perfectly with our digital characters.
<br>

<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/gif_5.jpg"">

<br>
It is a lot of work, but also quite exciting! You may ask yourself, how can they reach this level of detail? Are there very tiny people involved? They can't accomplish all of this with mere human hands, right? Well yes, we can! The answer might be our abundance of professional hands. Twenty-four seven at our disposal in all shapes and colors, they get things done!
<br>

<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/gif_8.jpg"">

<br>
Every scene gets an individual treatment and is staged with actual physical lighting. This allows us to simulate different hours of the day or weather conditions. Even a change of seasons is possible just by redecorating the set with real tiny little snowflakes, no joke.
<br>

<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/gif_6.jpg"">

<br>
This way we achieve an exceptional and magical look that visually reflects the world of Trüberbrook.
<br>

<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/gif_7.jpg"">

<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/en/gameplay.png"">

<br>
Trüberbrook is a story-driven adventure game with a strong focus on characters and the narrative, but includes a lot of puzzles that need to be solved to progress the story. The puzzles are designed to integrate into the narrative.
<br>

<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/gameplay_1.jpg"">

<br>
You navigate Tannhauser through the different sceneries from a third person perspective, usually in long distance shots to intensify the impression of peeking into a little diorama. The story unfolds as you interact with your environment, talk to other characters and solve puzzles. These range from inventory-based puzzles to social challenges (such as persuading other characters) up to passing unsettling psycho tests.
<br>

<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/gameplay_3.jpg"">

<br>
For the console versions, we came up with a very intuitive controller input, allowing you to move the line of sight and walking directions independently. For the PC versions, you can choose between classic point and click mouse controls, and the controller navigation.
<br>

<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/gameplay_5.jpg"">

<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/en/soundtrack.png"">

<br>
The soundtrack of Trüberbrook is an original composition to fit the mood of the game – sort of a tranquil doom jazz. Inspirations come from the works of <i>Tom Waits</i>, <i>Angelo Badalamenti</i>, <i>Mark Lanegan</i>, <i>Timber Timbre</i> or <i>Bohren & der Club of Gore</i>. The soundtrack is directed by Sebastian Nagel & Albrecht Schrader.
<br>

<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/en/localization.png"">

<br>
We've spent a lot of time working on a voice acting concept that joins in with the genetic code of the game. Since the protagonist is an American in the midst of a bunch of Germans, we wanted to reflect this in our choice of actors: In the international English audio, the main character Tannhauser speaks native American English, while all of the townspeople of Trüberbrook sport genuine German accents!

Create massive battles with absolutely no limits. Want to see 10,000 chickens fight an army of Romans?? Sure, why not. Want to see a company of WW2 U.S soldiers fight 11,000 Medieval soldiers?? There are simply no limits to the carnage you can achieve in Epic Battle Simulator. Mess around with a massive variety of units. Everything from, Roman Centurions, Medieval soldiers, Knights, Orcs, Trolls, and yes, chickens! The main focus in this game is giving the player no restrictions to what he can do. That is why we decided not to limit the amount of units in battle. Want to see what a battle of 100,000 units looks like? We don't recommend going past 10,000 for most machines but its your CPU, do what you want! On top of that, you can play as any one of the units in the game, getting up close and personal to help change the tides of a massive battle, while rallying teammates and giving them orders!<br><br>The Technology:<br><br>Unfortunately there really aren't many engines that you can chuck 10,000 characters in and expect good performance. This is why I worked months on end to create the most powerful crowd rendering system ever conceived in Unity engine. The detail of each character has little effect on performance while each individual acts independently, but is working towards a greater good for his team.  Each individual decides his own path and navigates complex environments. But I didn't stop there! With the large open environments, I needed a more dynamic lighting solution than the one built in to Unity engine. So I built my own dynamic global illumination lighting engine. This enables bounce light completely in real time. What does that mean? That means every piece of shiny armor is reflecting it's true surroundings, every bright surfaces illuminates it's surroundings and effects the overall lighting. <br><br>Yes I worked hard to bring this game to life, may you all inflict carnage upon it!",Brilliant Game Studios,Brilliant Game Studios,False,False,Single Player,616560,"Adventure, Indie, Simulator, Strategy",,False,12 Apr 2017,29 Jan 2021 00:00:00,,21 Jul 2022 23:05:35,29 Jan 2021 00:00:00,,Not Played,"Youtube:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV0vQTkEQrF1NLQnRWwR6_A, Steam:https://store.steampowered.com/app/616560, Official Website:https://www.brilliantgamestudios.com/",,,PC (Windows),0,0,cb91dfc9-b977-43bf-8e70-55f46e410fab,Steam,,,,60,45,,,2a5245ad-c2f1-4c34-9be2-a433c5962e95

Other games in the series include Tannenberg, set on the Eastern Front, and the upcoming Isonzo, featuring mountain warfare set on the Italian Front.</p>
<h1>Key Features</h1>
<ul>
<li>Experience World War One gameplay: Accurate weaponry, poisonous gas with a claustrophobic gas mask experience, horrendous gore effects, and ferocious artillery barrages</li>
<li>Tactical squad-based FPS: 15 distinctive squad types representing soldiers from 5+ countries, each with distinct weapons and equipment</li>
<li>True trench warfare: Real-time dynamic frontline with momentum based attack and counter-attack gameplay</li>
<li>Authentic World War 1 setting: Typical WW1 music and style, historical battlefields representing the key theaters on the Western Front</li>
</ul>
<h1>Game Modes</h1>
<p>The game offers 5 distinct game-modes with many historically accurate features such as realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on the real battlefields of France and Belgium. The dynamic Frontlines game mode features 64 players taking turns to go over the top and attempt to capture the opposing trench line.</p>
<h1>Authentic WW1 Combat</h1>
<p>The gameplay in this true WW1 battlefield experience is as immersive and gritty as it can get, with features such as optional realistic gore which portrays the true horror of the First World War and authentic weaponry including artillery and gas. Weapons need to be handled with skill - each gun handles differently and there are no floating crosshairs to aid your aim, along with realistic bullet physics to contend with.</p>
<p>Keep your head down or quickly don your mask in the event of artillery strikes or gas attacks. This unforgiving war isn’t for the faint hearted!</p>
<h1>Extensive Research</h1>
<p>For Verdun, we carried out extensive field research at the battlefield itself and were advised by knowledgeable historians to make sure the individual elements in Verdun are as historically accurate as it can get. Uniforms have been recreated to the tiniest detail, the weapons are modeled to exact references and the maps use realistic props and terrain layouts. Everything has been tailored to recreate the grim atmosphere so typical of WW1, from the immersive interface and war torn maps to realistic sounds and voices that evoke the feeling of actually being there in the muddy trenches.</p>

In einer nicht allzu fernen Zukunft gewann eine künstliche Intelligenz die Oberhand über alle anderen KIs und ihre Regierungen. Die Gesellschaft ist in eine permanente integrierte Realität migriert, die mit einem einzigen neuronalen Netzwerk verbunden ist, das ihre Erfahrungen durch die Verarbeitung persönlicher Daten ständig optimiert.<br>
<br>
Nathan, ein Außenseiter, der sich immer noch weigert, sich dem neuen System zu unterwerfen, verdient seinen Lebensunterhalt als Schmuggler von modifizierter Hardware und geknackter Software abseits des Netzes. Ausgerüstet mit seinem individuellen Headset gehört er zu den wenigen, die AVR noch abschalten und die Realität als das sehen können, was sie ist. Er teilt sich eine Wohnung in der Stadt mit seiner Freundin Jay, einer talentierten AVR-Graffitikünstlerin, deren Drohnen Techno-Farbe über den ganzen augmentierten Raum in der Stadt sprühen.<br>
<br>
Als Nathan eines Tages aufwacht, stellt er fest, dass Jay über Nacht verschwunden ist, sein Headset kaputt ist und eine kryptische Nachricht auf dem Badezimmerspiegel hinterlassen wurde. Abgeschnitten und entschlossen, herauszufinden, was mit Jay passiert ist, findet er sich auf einer unerwarteten Reise wieder, an der Jays Hackergruppe und eine Gilde von AVR-Technomancern beteiligt sind.<br>
<br>
Auf seiner Reise um die Welt muss er über Hardware-Friedhöfe gehen, sich mit digitaler Archäologie, Stämmen von Kryptoschamanen und Ausschweifungen in die virtuelle Realität auseinandersetzen.

Void Bastards,,"ESRB M, PEGI 16",,"<p>Forget everything you know about first-person shooters: Void Bastards asks you to take charge, not just point your gun and fire. Your task is to lead the rag-tag Void Bastards out of the Sargasso Nebula. You make the decisions: where to go, what to do and who to fight. And then you must carry out that strategy in the face of strange and terrible enemies.</p>
<p>On board derelict spaceships you’ll plan your mission, taking note of the ship layout, what hazards and enemies you might encounter and what terminals and other ship systems you can use to your advantage..</p>
<p>Move carefully through the dangerous ships, searching for supplies and manipulating control systems. React to what you find - will you detour to the generator to bring the power back online or will you fight your way into the security module to disable the ship’s defenses? Choose carefully when to fight, when to run and when just to be a bastard.</p>
<p>Use your hard won supplies to improvise tools and weapons, from the distracting robo-kitty to the horribly unstable clusterflak.</p>
<p>Navigate your tiny escape pod through the vast nebula. Flee from void whales and pirates, and politely avoid the hungry hermits. All the while you must keep scavenging for the food, fuel, and other resources that keep you alive.</p>
<p>Void Bastards features a 12-15 hour campaign that you can complete with an endless supply of prisoners, each with their own unique traits. When one dies, another steps forward to carry on the fight. Don’t worry though, as any crafting progress you’ve made is retained from one to another.</p>

Where The Water Tastes Like Wine,,"ESRB M, PEGI 16",,"<p>Where the Water Tastes Like Wine is a Narrative-Adventure game about traveling, sharing stories, and surviving manifest destiny.</p>
<p>Players wander across a folkloric Depression era United States at their own pace, meeting strangers with their own stories to tell. Through these interactions, players will be able to collect unique stories which can then be re-told to unlock new interactions.</p>
<h1>Features</h1>
<p><em>&quot;Big Rock Candy Mountain? El Dorado? The place over the hill where they say the water tastes just like the sweetest wine?&quot;</em></p>
<p>Travel the Depression-Era United States, laboring to pay off a debt by learning the true stories of 16 signature characters across a wide range of American experience from migrant workers to a travelling preacher to a Navajo woman forcibly relocated on the Long Walk.</p>
<p><em>&quot;This whole land's built on stories; it's one big story, America is&quot;</em></p>
<p>As you explore, you'll encounter strange and unsettling things: slices of a country built on dust clouds and murky dreams, where the folk tales are bleeding through. You'll carry those tales with you, swapping them round campfires to make the cast of characters open up to you and share their own stories.</p>
<p><em>&quot;The greatest stories are the true ones; the ones people will tell you about their own lives&quot;</em></p>
<p>The stories you share will return to you along your journey, changed in the telling as they've made their way around the country. As you meet the characters time and again on your travels, they will grow to trust you and, hopefully, share their true selves with you. Only by learning all their real stories can you pay off your debt.</p>
<ul>
<li>Beautiful combination of 3D overworld and hand drawn 2D illustrations</li>
<li>Original stories written by a wide selection of accomplished authors</li>
<li>Fully voiced characters from all walks of life brought to life by world-renowned voice acting talent, including Sting, Dave Fennoy (The Walking Dead: A Telltale Game Series), Cissy Jones (Firewatch), Kimberly Brooks (Mass Effect), Sarah Elmaleh (Gone Home), Melissa Hutchison (The Walking Dead: A Telltale Game Series), Elizabeth Maxwell (The Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild), and many more.</li>

while True: learn(),,,,"<h1>About this game</h1>
<p><strong>while True: learn()</strong> is a puzzle/simulation game about even more puzzling stuff: machine learning, neural networks, big data and AI. But most importantly, it’s about understanding your cat.</p>
<p>In this game, you play as a coder who accidentally found out that their cat is extremely good at coding, but not as good at speaking human language. Now this coder (it’s you!) must learn all there is to know about machine learning and use visual programming to build a cat-to-human speech recognition system.</p>
<h1>This game fits best for...</h1>
<ul>
<li>People who want to know more about how machine learning and related technologies work</li>
<li>Parents and teachers who are looking for a fun and easy way to make an intro to logical thinking, programming, and technologies for kids</li>
<li>Players who like to keep their brains busy and working in different ways, while still having fun</li>
<li>Gamers looking to improve their problem-solving skills and feel immense sense of satisfaction and achievement that comes along with it</li>
<li>People who like smart cats</li>
</ul>
<h1>Learn how machine learning works in real life!</h1>
<p>The game is loosely based on real-life machine learning technologies: from goofy Expert Systems to mighty Recurrent Neural Networks, capable of predicting the future. Don’t worry: it all plays out as a puzzle game. No coding experience required!</p>
<h1>Train yourself into a data science wizard!</h1>
<p>Drag objects around your screen with a mouse! Connect them with lines (oh yeah)! Try. Fail. Optimize. Try again. Then press “Release” button and see that sweet pieces of data flow smoothly through your screen.</p>
<h1>Embrace an adventurous lifestyle of a machine learning specialist!</h1>
<p>Designing a groundbreaking technology requires time, experience and money. That means you’ll have to work as a freelancer, with all the excitement that comes along with it. Receive emails! Accept contracts! Sit alone in a dark room for days without saying a single word! Socialize on forums! That’s what real data scientists do!</p>
<h1>Coding just got real!</h1>
<p>Our quests are based on actual problems, solved by machine learning. This includes building a self-driving car (with your cat as a pilot). And if you really want to test your programming might, you can become a CTO of a startup: it’s your skills and your schemes against the savage laws of the market! Earn a fortune, flip off your bosses and become a tech guru… Or lose everything and crawl back to the doorstep of HR department: at least it was worth trying, right?</p>
<h1>Improve your gear, improve your life!</h1>
<p>Once you ensure a stable cashflow, you’ll be able to buy yourself a bunch of fancy hardware to improve your performance. But it’s not just about the hardware! Buy yourself a new smartphone or a geeky figurine! Buy fancy outfits for your cat! Hell, you can even buy yourself an aloe!</p>
<h1>Fun fact</h1>
<p>This is what machine learning specialists actually do. Now, you can become one of them (minus the money)! <strong>while True: learn()</strong> is the best game about being a data science specialist because no one else has been weird enough to make another one!</p>

<p>Earth has changed. Twenty years have passed since world leaders offered an unconditional surrender to alien forces. XCOM, the planet’s last line of defense, was left decimated and scattered. Now, in XCOM 2, the aliens rule Earth, building shining cities that promise a brilliant future for humanity on the surface, while concealing a sinister agenda and eliminating all who dissent from their new order.</p>
<p>Only those who live at the edges of the world have a margin of freedom. Here, a force gathers once again to stand up for humanity. Always on the run, and facing impossible odds, the remnant XCOM forces must find a way to ignite a global resistance, and eliminate the alien threat once and for all.</p>
<p>XCOM ON THE RUN: Take command of the Avenger, an alien supply craft converted to XCOM’s mobile headquarters. New open-ended gameplay lets you decide where to guide your strike team, how to grow popular support, and when to combat enemy counter-operations.</p>
<p>RECRUIT RESISTANCE FIGHTERS: Five soldier classes, each with its own skill tree, let you create specific soldiers for your tactical plan.</p>
<p>TACTICAL GUERRILLA COMBAT: New gameplay systems offer more tactical flexibility in combat. Use concealment to ambush enemy patrols. Loot enemies for precious gear and artifacts. Rescue VIPs and save fallen comrades by carrying them to the extraction point.</p>
<p>A NEW BREED OF ENEMY: A diverse cast of enemies from powerful new alien species to the ADVENT, enforcers of the alien regime, offer a distinct tactical challenge.</p>
<p>RESEARCH, DEVELOP AND UPGRADE: Configure and build rooms on the Avenger to give XCOM new capabilities on the battlefield. Use your Scientists and Engineers to research, develop and upgrade weapons and armor to fit your preferred tactics.</p>
<p>EACH MISSION IS A UNIQUE CHALLENGE: Go on missions around the world, from wildlands to the heart of the alien-controlled megacities, to the depths of alien installations. There are virtually infinite combinations of maps, missions and goals.</p>

<i>Yes, Your Grace</i> tells a tale of Davern, a medieval kingdom ruled by King Eryk. The game is set in a fictional world where monsters and arcane practices inspired by Slavic folklore are the order of the day. Villagers will ask for your help with various problems, from monsters attacking the village to a lack of places to relax and enjoy themselves. Some will bring humour to your throne room and some will present you with difficult choices. Your family is important too, and throughout your time as King, you will have to support them in their struggles.
<br>
<br>
You will face lords with a variety of personalities; you will need their support in order to win an upcoming battle, but some may ask you to perform dirty deeds to cement the alliance. One thing is clear: It won’t be easy to keep everyone happy...
