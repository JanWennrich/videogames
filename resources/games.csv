2064: Read Only Memories,,ESRB M,,"<p><strong>2064: Read Only Memories</strong> merges old-school adventure gaming with modern storytelling to explore some of the social challenges we will face in the near future.

<p>The world is changing.</p>
<p>Genetic alteration of humans is now commonplace, with many choosing to radically alter their bodies to express their individuality. Virtual intelligences called ROMs (Relationship and Organizational Managers), created as simple digital assistants, are exerting greater control over people’s lives. Some are terrified by this rapid change, and they are willing to go to extreme lengths to prevent it.</p>

<p>A lost ROM named Turing breaks into the apartment of a struggling journalist to ask for help. They claim to be the first sapient machine—not a simulation of life but a genuinely self-aware artificial being—and the technical genius who created them has gone missing. Can you unravel the shocking conspiracy that threatens to rock an entire society? Or will the darkness that lies behind the bright neon lights of Neo-SF consume you?</p>

<p>Strategic freedom is yours. Hulking space derelicts called megaliths bring 3D terrain into the classic Homeworld battlespace. Use the crumbling remains of an ancient civilization to funnel foes into a brilliant ambush or hide your fleet from powerful enemies. Fortresses teem with menacing turrets and invite your strike craft into dangerous trench runs deep behind enemy lines. But not everything is in your control. Dangerous space phenomena like particle storms and asteroid fields will test even senior commanders.</p>

<p>Homeworld’s timeless art style evolves with modern technology, offering an incredible sense of scale, destruction, and wonder. Strike craft fly in formation between hulking Battlecruisers against a backdrop of stars and nebulae. Iconic ships cast silhouettes over the remains of ancient civilizations. Explosions ripple and erupt across hulls as one fleet stakes its victory over another.</p>

<p>Homeworld’s game-of-the-year winning story continues. Since the end of Homeworld 2, the galaxy enjoyed an age of abundance thanks to the Hyperspace Gate Network. Cycles of plenty and war have come and gone. Now the gates themselves are catastrophically failing and Karan, who has passed into myth and religious idolatry, is the key to the mystery threatening a galaxy’s future.</p>

<p>An all-new, co-op capable multiplayer mode extends your game beyond the campaign. Fusing Homeworld’s RTS gameplay with roguelike structure, one or two commanders take on a randomized series of fleet combat challenges.

The story takes place before the events from Alder's Blood and changes the perspective from Chief of the Hunters - to a commoner, named Charles. <br>
<br>
Charles, as everyone else in this cruel world, is struggling to stay alive. Daring his luck, out of bravery or desperation - he aims for a quick buck and attempts to hunt the spawns of darkness. If he'll survive - income from reselling the remains of the beasts will secure his livelihood for weeks to come.<br>
<br>
What he is not aware of, is how his story will soon unfold and his life... changed forever.<br>
<br>
In the world ruled by misery and humanity rotting in shadow of God's dead carcass - death, becomes mercy.

Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs,,,,"<i>The Swine are Rising! </i>
<br>
In 2010 Frictional Games terrified the world with the cult horror Amnesia: A Dark Descent. Now they bring you a new nightmare. Created in collaboration with The Chinese Room, the studio behind Dear Esther, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is an intense and terrifying journey into the heart of darkness
that lurks within us all.
<br><br>
<i>The year is 1899</i>
<br>
Wealthy industrialist Oswald Mandus awakes in his bed, wracked with fever and haunted by dreams
of a dark and hellish engine. Tortured by visions of a disastrous expedition to Mexico, broken on the
failing dreams of an industrial utopia, wracked with guilt and tropical disease, he wakes into a
nightmare. The house is silent, the ground beneath him shaking at the will of some infernal machine:
all he knows is that his children are in grave peril, and it is up to him to save them.
<br><br>
<i>Step back into the horror</i>
<br>
Like The Dark Descent, this is a game driven by its story, exploration of the world and the constant
fear of the unknown. You can expect classic Amnesia gameplay, physics interaction and the
signature blend of high-end gaming with low system requirements.
<br><br>
<i>Think you understand fear? Think again. </i>
<br>
A Machine for Pigs takes both the world of Amnesia and the technology of The Dark Descent to new
heights of horror. Built using an updated version of HPL2 engine, the game features stunning visual
and environment design, incredible music and audio effects and adapted artificial intelligence. These
are all driven by a gut-wrenching, blood-curdling new story, set sixty years after the events of the
original game.",The Chinese Room,Frictional Games,False,True,Single Player,1207659443,"Adventure, Indie, Puzzle",,False,10 Sep 2013,19 Aug 2024 20:00:44,,19 Aug 2024 20:01:58,19 Aug 2024 20:00:44,,Not Played,"Steam:https://store.steampowered.com/app/239200, Official:http://www.aamfp.com, Wikipedia:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesia:_A_Machine_for_Pigs, Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/frictionalgames, Twitter:https://twitter.com/frictionalgames, YouTube:https://www.youtube.com/user/frictionalgames, GOG:https://www.gog.com/game/amnesia_a_machine_for_pigs, Wikia:https://amnesia.fandom.com/wiki/Amnesia:_A_Machine_for_Pigs, Epic:https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/amnesia-a-machine-for-pigs, Instagram:https://instagram.com/frictionalgames/, Discord:https://discord.gg/frictionalgames, Twitch:https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Amnesia:%20A%20Machine%20for%20Pigs",,,PC (Windows),0,0,aebe8b7c-6dc3-4a66-af31-e7375c6b5e9e,GOG,,Amnesia,"[DH] Hidden, Adventure, Atmospheric, Dark, Exploration, First-Person, FPS, Horror, Indie, Lovecraftian, Mystery, Psychological Horror, Puzzle, Short, Story Rich, Survival Horror, Walking Simulator",67,73,,,9c8e28bf-7597-4d38-bfbb-3afd37ec5256

Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing &amp; armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/PlantFarmGrow.png?t=1655137924"" /><br><br>Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians &amp; vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner!<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/Summon.png?t=1655137924"" /><br><br>By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK’s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle.

More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new &quot;Engrams&quot; to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you'll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D &quot;Explorer Notes&quot;. By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose!<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/HardcoreMechanics.png?t=1655137924"" /><br><br>Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted &amp; stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames!<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/ExploreAndDiscover.png?t=1655137924"" /><br><br>The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text &amp; voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct &amp; draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK?

You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK's by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique 'Procedurally Generated ARKs', for infinite replayability and endless surprises.<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/RobustSteamWorkshop.png?t=1655137924"" /><br><br>You can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer.

Aven Colony,,"ESRB E10, PEGI 12",,"<p>Discover Aven Prime - an alien planet of deserts, tundras, and jungles light years from earth. Aven Colony puts you in charge of humanity's first extrasolar settlement, where you build and expand your small colonies into massive, sprawling cities while dealing with the challenges faced when settling on a new world.</p>
<p>Build your colony's infrastructure, look after the well-being of your citizens, manage your resources, and guide your colony to prosperity against the backdrop of the harsh and often dangerous realities of the exotic world of Aven Prime.</p>
<h1>KEY FEATURES:</h1>
<p><strong>COLONIZE AN ALIEN WORLD:</strong> Build a new home for humanity on a world with a low-oxygen atmosphere, extreme electrical storms, shard storms, dust devils, deadly toxic gas eruptions from geothermal vents, and days so long they have their own seasons. Explore a variety of biomes, from the lush wetlands environment to the much less habitable desert and arctic.</p>
<p><strong>MEET THE LOCALS:</strong> Encounter a variety of alien life forms, including giant sandworms, deadly plague spores, and a vicious fungal infection known as “The Creep.”</p>
<p><strong>SUPERVISE YOUR COLONISTS:</strong> Settling a new world can be stressful. As a new Colony Governor, you’ll need to work overtime to help your colonists deal with their new environment. Using the 12 distinct &quot;overlay&quot; modes, you can mange your colony's Crops, Citizens, Happiness, Crime, Air, Electricity, Employment, Resources, Commute, Structures, Drones, and Water. Earn the respect of your colonists, and rise in rank from Colony Governor to Expedition President!</p>
<p><strong>DISCOVER THE PAST:</strong> The world of Aven Prime holds many secrets. Play through a full single-player campaign and participate in a story that reveals some of the many secrets of this brave new world.</p>
<p><strong>BUILD THE FUTURE:</strong> Use construction drones to build dozens of types of structures to house your colonists, establish trading routes, welcome immigrants and much more! Enhance your existing buildings through several upgrade tiers to push your colony to new heights!</p>
<p><strong>EXPEDITION SYSTEM:</strong> Deploy your crack team of pioneers to explore alien ruins, recover artifacts, repair crashed vessels and rescue lost explorers. Get ready to take on plague and creep spore nests whilst fending off splinter groups, rebels and Aven Prime's remaining robot guardians which threaten your new civilisation.</p>
<p><strong>PREPARE FOR WINTER:</strong> A fully functional day/night and seasonal cycle. During the winter Aven Prime freezes over - farms will not grow food and solar panels will generate far less electricity. Take measures to survive this harsh climate!</p>

Brütal Legend,,"ESRB M, PEGI 18",,"Brütal Legend is an action-adventure that marries visceral action combat with open-world freedom. Set in a universe somewhere between Lord of the Rings and Spinal Tap, it’s a fresh take on the action/driving genre, which in this case is full of imitation cover bands, demons intent on enslaving humanity and Heavy metal tunes. Featuring the talents of comedian, actor and musician, Jack Black as super roadie Eddie Riggs, as well as cameos by some of the biggest names in metal music it's a wild ride in the belly of the beast that is not to be missed by gamers and Metalheads alike.<br> <br><br>Included as a free bonus in the PC version of Brütal Legend are both the Hammer of Infinite Fate and Tears of the Hextadon multiplayer map packs.<br><br><br><strong>Story</strong><br>The vivid and wildly creative world of Brütal Legend is brought to life through a spate of chrome, leather, rocker babes, epic music, fire-breathing/stud-wearing beasts, mountains made of guitar amps, and more. Follow Eddie as he embarks on a tour of epic destruction with an axe, a guitar, and his minions as he commands the power of rock in epic band battles. It’s lighter-flicking awesomeness that will melt your face clean off.<br><br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Brütal Legend’s combat is a combination of classic action slasher and real time strategy mechanics.  Melee and ranged combat come from your double-sided broadaxe and demon-slaying, pyrotechnic-creating guitar.  Add that 1-2 punch to a guitar solo mechanic that can summon objects, buff your teammates, or cripple your opponents, and you have a deep, gratifying core gameplay combat loop that is fun for the hardcore and accessible for the casual.  On top of that, players will journey from Roadie to Rock God by commanding legions of metalheads into Brütal Victory and sending troops charging into battle.<br><br><br><strong>A Streaming Open World</strong><br>Brütal Legend gives you the freedom to walk, drive, or fly anywhere in a fully streaming open world whose art style is inspired by some of the most iconic and hilariously rad metal album covers ever created. Every vista in the beautiful universe of Brütal Legend looks like it was pulled from a Frank Frazetta painting.<br><br><br><strong>Packed With Cameos and Voice Talent</strong><br>Brütal Legend is full of cameos from gods of metal like Lemmy Kilmister, Rob Halford, Lita Ford, and many, many others. It has a MASSIVE metal soundtrack from every era of metal music: 1970’s classic metal to 1980’s hair metal to the scarier cousins of 1990’s metal. And of course, Jack Black pays the ultimate homage to metal as Eddie the Roadie, continuing the theme from the work of his band, Tenacious D and his previous films like School of Rock and High Fidelity.<br><br><br><strong>Multiplayer Mayhem</strong><br>4v4 &quot;skirmish&quot; multiplayer marries action combat with a strategic unit-control mechanic. As the leader of one of the factions in the game, the player will direct his armies in a Battle of the Bands where the trophy is survival. Brütal Legend’s multiplayer is online-enabled, so you can conquer your friends online (broadband connection required for online play).<br><br><br><strong>Music</strong><br>The music in Brütal Legend is truly massive.

Builders of Egypt: Prologue,,,,"<b>Builders Of Egypt</b> ist ein Wirtschafts-Strategiespiel und gleichzeitig eine Städtebausimulation, die im Niltal spielt. ODie Geschichte beginnt in der wenig bekannten prädynastischen Zeit, wo man die Entstehung des Alten Ägypten, beobachten kann, und endet mit dem Tod von Kleopatra VII. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/builders_of_egypt/gog_main_01.jpg""><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Der wichtigste Aspekt ist die geschickte Verwaltung der Stadtplanung durch die Gestaltung des Straßennetzes, den Bau von Gebäuden und deren Nachbarschaft. Eine gut gestaltete Stadt wird die wirtschaftliche Effizienz erheblich verbessern, was sich weiterhin in Einnahmen widerspiegelt.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Diplomatie und Politik:</b><br>
<br>
<br>
Der Stadtmanager wird in einem sich ständig verändernden politischen Umfeld vor schwierigen Entscheidungen stehen. Teure Expeditionen, Befehle des Pharaos, Anfragen aus anderen Städten, militärische Bedrohungen und die Mischung verschiedener Kulturen werden zum täglichen Brot. Eine Reihe von falschen Entscheidungen kann uns den Verlust unserer Handelspartner und die Abneigung potenzieller Siedler kosten, und ein völliger Mangel an Gehorsam gegenüber dem Herrscher kann zu einem Bürgerkrieg führen.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/builders_of_egypt/gog_main_02.jpg""><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Religion:</b><br>
<br>
<br>
Die Götter können in das Alltagsleben eingreifen, aber dies wird im Geheimen geschehen. Der Hauptaspekt der Religion wird darin bestehen, den Bedarf an Zugang zu Kultstätten zu erfüllen, Güter für Tempel zu liefern, Festivals und Opet-Feste zu organisieren. Vernachlässigung dieser Werte kann zu sozialen Unruhen führen, die genauso gefährlich sind wie z.B. Hunger. <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Handel:</b><br>
<br>
<br>
Handel ist das wichtigste Element, das die königliche Schatzkammer füllt. Es wäre sehr schwierig, wirtschaftliche Stabilität, die ausschließlich auf Steuern beruht, zu erreichen. Daher liegt es im Interesse des Spielers, Waren für den Export zu solchen Preisen zu produzieren, die sich abhängig von der geopolitischen Situation dynamisch ändern können.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/builders_of_egypt/gog_main_03.jpg""><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Monumente:</b><br>
<br>
<br>
Was wäre Altes Ägypten ohne seine monumentale, sakrale Architektur? Auf den Spieler warten Mastabas, Obelisken, Tempel in Karnak, Ramesseum und natürlich Pyramiden.  Es ist möglich, den langsamen Prozess ihrer Entstehung zu beobachten. Das Gebäude wird von Zimmerleuten, Steinmetzen, Architekten und einfachen Arbeitern Schritt für Schritt gebaut. Dies ist nicht nur ein ein visueller Prozess - der Bauprozess stellt eine große finanzielle Belastung dar und hat Auswirkungen auf die Finanzen oder die soziale Stimmung.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Kriege:</b><br>
<br>
<br>
Die Geschichte Ägyptens ist voll von Kriegen entstehender und untergehender Imperien. Du bist verantwortlich für die Verteidigung der Städte gegen die Angriffe ausländischer Truppen, die Erstellung von Angriffsplänen und die Teilnahme an der Kampagne auf Befehl des Pharaos.<br>

Expand your demesne and secure the future of your dynasty. Fill your coffers, appoint vassals, root out traitors and heretics, introduce laws and interact with hundreds of nobles, each with their own agenda.

<p>After 700 years of peace and prosperity, the Galactic Empire has suddenly been shattered into pieces. The OMNIs, god-like machines which did everything for their human masters, have mysteriously shut down. And humankind, having long since lost the ability to survive on its own, is dangerously close to extinction. But somewhere in a far corner of the Galaxy is Gehenna, a planet of ice and rock and a top-secret facility that is the pinnacle of Imperial Tech and also humanity’s last chance.</p>
<p>You are a clone of Admiral Ellys Idaho, a weapon fashioned from flesh, the best Imperial Admiral ever to battle in the stars and you have just been awoken on this planet by its strange and darkly-humorous Guardian, Kaliban, the last functional OMNI to exist.</p>
<p>Your mission: skillfully command a battleship through the Empire's now chaotic, violent clusters ––where one wrong move could be your last–– as you try to reactivate the OMNIs and save the future of all humankind. But you must leave Gehenna now.... for time has almost run out.</p>

Dark Souls is a spiritual successor to Demon’s, not a sequel. Prepare for a new, despair-inducing world, with a vast, fully-explorable horizon and vertically-oriented landforms. Prepare for a new, mysterious story, centered around the the world of Lodran, but most of all, prepare to die. You will face countless murderous traps, countless darkly grotesque mobs and several gargantuan, supremely powerful demons and dragons bosses. You must learn from death to persist through this unforgiving world. And you aren’t alone. Dark Souls allows the spirits of other players to show up in your world, so you can learn from their deaths and they can learn from yours. You can also summon players into your world to co-op adventure, or invade other's worlds to PVP battle. New to Dark Souls are Bonfires, which serve as check points as you fight your way through this epic adventure. While rested at Bonfires, your health and magic replenish but at a cost, all mobs respawn. Beware: There is no place in Dark Souls that is truly safe.

<br>

<br>
In a grim dystopian future, where mankind has scattered across the galaxy and the human society has split into two distinct classes, you are a poor stateless outcast forced to live off scraps from derelict alien stations and ships in the outer space, yet you dream of becoming a privileged citizen and living on the surface of a habitable planet, enjoying non-synthetic air, water and food. A fabled alien derelict ship somewhere within the Deep Sky sector of space is your voucher for a citizenship and a promise of cozy life on a hospitable planet.
<br>

<br>
Build and control a squad of up to three mercenary characters and set on to explore derelict ships within your reach from the scavenger's base. Searching the derelicts for loot and clues, you come across many friendly inhabitants and traders, but more often – various enemies. Challenge and defeat them in tactical turn-based fights, where randomly-drawn cards form your changing arsenal of combat actions, gain experience for yourself and your crew, loot dead bodies, resupply and upgrade once back at your base. The scavenger's home ship gives you the opportunity to heal and level-up your mercenaries, recruit new ones, equip them, upgrade their gear or recharge energy for life support during missions.

Delores: A Thimbleweed Park Mini-Adventure,,,,"The year is 1988. Adventure game developer Delores Edmund, on hiatus from her job at MMucasFlem Games, has returned to Thimbleweed Park for a quick vacation. While she’s home, she’s making some extra money as a photographer for the Thimbleweed Nickel News. Hey, game developers need to eat, too!
<br>

<br>
Thimbleweed Park hasn’t changed at all in the year since Delores has been away… or has it? 
<br>

<br>
…Since when is the S&D Diner a five-star establishment?
<br>
…When did the PillowBear™ become all the rage?
<br>
…Why is Ransome the Clown suddenly winning humanitarian awards? 
<br>
…How come no one seems to remember that dead body that turned up under the bridge a year ago?
<br>
…Can Thimbleweed Park get any stranger?!.
<br>

<br>
In a town like Thimbleweed Park, a side career in photojournalism is the least of your problems...
<br>

<br>
<b>Delores: A Thimbleweed Park Mini-Adventure</b> started out as a prototype for Ron Gilbert’s new point-and-click adventure game engine and grew into a fun little game. It is not a sequel to Thimbleweed Park and is probably missing all of the small bells and whistles that would make it a commercially viable game.
<br>

<br>
This was a challenging game to make because we had to use almost exclusively “found art” from Thimbleweed Park to create all new puzzles. Also because we couldn’t go outside IRL.
<br>

<br>
As a thank you to our fans, we are releasing it for free as something you can have fun with in these odd times. You don’t have to have played Thimbleweed Park to enjoy this mini-adventure.

Frostpunk,,"ESRB M, PEGI 16",,"<p>Frostpunk, the newest title from the creators of This War of Mine, is a society survival game where heat means life and every decision comes at a price. In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. You face the task of building the last city on Earth and securing the means necessary for your community to survive.</p>
<h1>THE CITY MUST SURVIVE</h1>
<p>Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the ruler’s time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and present state.
What decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And who will you become in the process?</p>
<h1>MAKE THE LAW</h1>
<p>Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe.</p>
<h1>SHAPE YOUR SOCIETY</h1>
<p>If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Whichever you choose, remember: there’s no turning back.</p>
<h1>WEIGH UP YOUR CHOICES</h1>
<p>Some of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. Leadership can be a burden.</p>
<h1>DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES</h1>
<p>Survival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills.</p>
<h1>EXPLORE THE FROSTLAND</h1>
<p>While New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society’s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands.</p>
<h1>PLAY ENDLESSLY</h1>
<p>Frostpunk Endless Mode grants you unlimited replayability for the game. Play on 8 various maps, with different terrain, weather conditions and challenges to face. We know that different people look for different experiences and that’s why there are 3 modes available. Endurance will be an ultimate test to your building, managing and survival skills in the harshest conditions. Builders, where there is no generator available from the start, which creates a different type of challenge. Serenity which is focused on enjoying the art of building the city itself, without unnecessary pressure.</p>

</a><br><hr><br>In Ghost of a Tale begleitest du eine mutige Bardenmaus namens Tilo auf ihrer gefährlichen Mission, bei der sie den Verliesen von Burg Dieruin entflieht und das Schicksal ihrer wahren Liebe, Merra, aufdeckt. Ghost of a Tale spielt in einer Mittelalterwelt, in der Ratten über alle anderen Geschöpfe herrschen. Es spinnt eine epische und doch vertraute Geschichte, und kombiniert Elemente von klassischen Adventures, Action-Rollenspielen und Erkundung mit einem hochqualitativen Grafikstil, der dich in seinen Bann ziehen wird.<br>
<br>
Ausgerüstet mit Mäusetalenten wie Heimlichkeit, Beweglichkeit und Tarnung – sowie dem Gespür eines Barden für Musik – erkundest du die verfallene Burg von ihren ausgedehnten Wäldern und Ufern bis hin zu den spinnenverseuchten Katakomben, umgehst dabei allerlei Gefahren und deckst ihre uralten Geheimnisse auf. <br>
<br>
Burg Dieruin ist ein gefährlicher Ort für eine kleine Maus und Tilo ist alles andere als ein Krieger. Wenn du tödlichen Gegnern, die auch noch doppelt so groß sind, entgegenblickst, sind List und Gewandtheit deine einzigen Verbündeten. Sprich mit den Bewohnern von Burg Dieruin, mache deine Feinde zu Freunden, und drehe auf deiner Mission, Merra zu finden, jeden Stein um.<br>

Der Spieler übernimmt die Rolle der drei Geschwister Greak, Adara und Raydel und leitet sie durch das Land Azur. Dabei muss geschickt zwischen den dreien gewechselt werden, um mit ihren einzigartigen Fähigkeiten vor der Urlag-Invasion zu entkommen.
<br>

<br>
Greak ist der Name des Hauptcharakters und des kleinsten Bruders von dreien. Er gehört zum magischen Volk der Courine, die gerade von einer Fraktion namens Urlag angegriffen werden. 
<br>

<br>
Der Kampf hat sich schon lange abgezeichnet, und die Courine beginnen, aus ihrem eigenen Land zu fliehen. Greaks Ziel ist es, seinen Bruder Raydel und seine Schwester Adara zu finden und dann aus Azur zu entkommen, indem die drei Stück für Stück ein Luftschiff bauen.
<br>

<br>
Im Laufe des Spiels findet der Spieler die Geschwister in eigenen Leveln und wird dann im weiteren Spielverlauf von ihnen begleitet und erhält ihre Hilfe.<h4>Wichtigste Features:</h4>

<br>
Blaze a trail back to the dark heart of the West in Hard West 2.
<br><br>
You are Gin Carter, a notorious outlaw with a reputation as dangerous as the frontier itself.
<br><br>
On the hunt for a big score, you hear talk that the legendary “Ghost Train” is heading your way loaded with federal gold. This is the one.
<br><br>
You swiftly assemble a posse of outlaws, some with guns, others with the kind of supernatural skills that make saloon bars fall silent in a split second.
<br><br>
Night falls and the posse rides out, silhouetted in the spectral light of the moon. Together, you transform the prairie into an ungodly land echoing with gunfire and the screams of the hunted.
<br><br>
But once on board the train, you discover it’s not named the “Ghost Train” for nothing. What follows is the fight of your life through the uncharted badlands of the Hard West, propelled by bullets, witchcraft, and your pursuit of personal salvation at any cost.
<br><br>
Chase down the devil himself and take back what he stole — your soul.

<br>
Berlin, 9th November 1989: The streets are full of people. After four decades of division, thousands of cars are rolling across the inner-German border. The Wall is finally open!
<br>
 
<br>
At the same time a man disappears in a secret research facility near East Berlin. His goodbye message reaches you too late. You drive back to the office, where the State Security has already destroyed all records of the research project. The complex is deserted and empty.
<br>
 
<br>
The search for Walter takes you deep into the center of the facility - right into the heart of the universe, where time seems to stand still. The dark secret lurks - well hidden - behind the curtain. In the end, it is horrible insights and the questions of responsibility that make you dive deeper and deeper into a strange, surreal yet familiar world.

<br>
Janosik was a legendary Slovak highlander rogue. According to the legend, he robbed nobles and gave the loot to the poor, just like Robin Hood. The game is based on popular legends in which Janosik had special magical items given to him (usually) by witches. Those items gave him superhuman strength, protected him from bullets, or gave him the ability to jump over the trees. In some legends, Janosik fights with supernatural beings. 
<br>

<br>
We took inspiration from the legends both for this game and the upcoming Janosik 2, and highly recommend that you read more about this hero if you enjoyed playing our retro platformer.

<h1>Just Die Already is an old people mayhem sandbox game created by the designers of Goat Simulator.</h1>
<p>You are an old retired person in a near future where people aren’t having any children. There isn’t anyone to pay for pensions due to those ungrateful millennials who prefer playing video games instead of doing actual work. With no one to cover your living costs, you - just like all other old people in this world - have no other choice but to survive on your own.</p>
<p><strong>How will you survive in a world that wants you to Just Die Already?</strong></p>
<p>To make things worse, you’ve just been kicked out of your retirement home, and your only option now is to perform dangerous challenges and explore the world for retirement tickets to qualify for free retirement care.</p>
<p><strong>So with society wishing you dead, isn’t it finally time to live a little?</strong></p>
<h1>BE OLD, BE BOLD</h1>
<p>You get to be an old person. Angry, fragile, poor and hating the world: the dream you didn’t know you had until now. Finally, you have found something in common with your grandparents.</p>

This version of the game contains around 1-2 hours of gameplay and introduces Legend of Keepers mechanics, lore building and game strategy.<h4>Features</h4>
<ul class=""bb_ul""><li> Place traps, launch spells and slay these damn heroes looting your dungeons
<br>
</li><li> Fight with your monsters and discover their unique abilities
<br>

</li><li> Deal with employees strikes and other fun events</li></ul><h4>RogueDefender</h4>
Each run will be different but players will keep some bonuses for their master between runs. In fact, our game is a mix between Roguelite and a Dungeon Management. How did we achieve that? We've run many tests to find the perfect mix between a management and a dungeon phase!

First, you will have to plan your defense against a group of adventurers. Check their stats and resistances, then place the best traps and monsters to defeat them! When you think your dungeon is ready, let the crawl begin!
<br>

<br>
You will then be able to watch those heroes die! It's a reversed dungeon crawler, heroes will move through your dungeon and will trigger the traps you've placed. When a group of adventurers meets a group of monsters you've positioned in your dungeon, a turn-based fight will happen!

"Lovecraft's Untold Stories",,"ESRB T, PEGI 16",," Lovecraft’s Untold Stories ist ein Action-Roguelite mit RPG-Elementen. Sie erkunden zufällig generierte Level, die in H. P. Lovecrafts Geschichten angesiedelt sind, kämpfen gegen Kultisten und diverse aus dem Mythos bekannte Monster, verbessern Ihre Waffen und Ihre Ausrüstung, lösen Rätsel, meistern Herausforderungen und suchen nach Hinweisen und Informationen, um die Großen Alten und die Äußeren Götter zu besiegen.<h4><b>LIVE H.P. LOVECRAFT’S STORIES </b></h4>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/lovecrafts_untold_stories/Hospital3_small.jpg"">

<br>
Lovecraft’s Untold Stories basiert auf den Geschichten von H. P. Lovecraft. Hier können Sie den kosmischen Horror, diese Ausgeburt der Fantasie des Genies aus Providence, hautnah erleben. Jede Spielfigur muss ihre eigenen Ermittlungen anstellen, die sie an die unterschiedlichsten Orte führen werden, von einer unheimlichen alten viktorianischen Villa bis hin zum verlassenen Hospital, in dem verbotene Experimente durchgeführt werden oder in den Dschungel, wo Eingeborenenstämme längst vergessen geglaubte Rituale zelebrieren. Die Level werden nach dem Zufallsprinzip generiert, so wird jedes Spiel garantiert zu einem einzigartigen Erlebnis. Außerdem unterscheiden sie sich je nach der Spielfigur, mit der Sie gerade spielen. Halten Sie nach Gegenständen und Hinweisen Ausschau, um Geheimnisse aufzudecken und neue Geschichten zu finden!

<h4><b>5 SPIELFIGUREN, 5 METHODEN, GEGEN DEN MYTHOS ZU KÄMPFEN </b></h4>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/lovecrafts_untold_stories/LUT-GHOUL.gif"">

<br>
Jeder der 5 Spielcharaktere hat einen individuellen Spielstil und eine eigene Geschichte. Begleiten Sie einen hartgesottenen Privatdetektiv, eine Hexe, eine Diebin, einen Professor oder gar einen Ghoul auf ihrer Reise ins Unbekannte. Jede Spielfigur hat eigene Attribute, Waffen und Kampfstile. So wird jedes neue Spiel zu einem einzigartigen Erlebnis. Der Detektiv hat durchschnittliche Gesundheit und Ausdauer und bietet so einen ausgeglichenen Spielstil. Der Professor spezialisiert sich auf den Distanzkampf, hat weniger Gesundheit und einen besonderen Energieschild, den seine Waffe, der Tillinghast-Apparat, generiert. Die Hexe verursacht sehr viel Schaden, kann teleportieren und setzt zudem Elementarschilde aus Eis und Feuer ein, ihr Vorrat an Lebensenergie ist allerdings sehr begrenzt. Die Diebin ist eine Nahkampfspezialistin, die Tarnung und Täuschung nutzt, um maximalen Schaden zu bewirken. Der Ghoul verursacht im Nahkampf sehr viel Schaden, hat viel Lebensenergie und ist imstande, sich selbst zu heilen, kann jedoch keine Verbandskästen benutzen.

<h4><b>ENTDECKEN SIE DIE GEHEIMNISSE DER GROSSEN ALTEN </b></h4>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/lovecrafts_untold_stories/LUT-WITCH.gif"">

<br>
Die düstere Wahrheit um die Schrecken, die dem Universum innewohnen, ist für den menschlichen Verstand unerträglich. Letzten Endes können Sie gegen die Alten nicht bestehen. Auf Sie warten nur Tod oder Wahnsinn. Doch vielleicht vermögen Sie es, das Unvermeidliche hinauszuzögern ... Wenn Sie den Großen Alten gegenübertreten, ohne das Geringste über sie zu wissen, fallen Sie allein bei ihrem abstoßenden Anblick dem Wahnsinn anheim. Jedoch können Sie, verteilt auf allen Leveln, besondere Gegenstände finden, die Informationen über die Großen Alten enthalten. Je mehr Sie über sie wissen, desto besser ist auch Ihr Verstand gewappnet. Doch Wissen ist nicht leicht zu erlangen! Wenn Sie bei Ihren Ermittlungen nicht gründlich genug vorgehen, könnte es passieren, dass Sie am Ende einer der Geschichten anlangen, ohne alles gefunden zu haben, was es zu wissen gibt. Sie müssen mit jedem der Spielcharaktere spielen, wenn Sie alle Informationen über jeden der Großen Alten finden möchten!

<h4><b>DER WAHNSINN LAUERT  </b></h4>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/lovecrafts_untold_stories/LUT-THIEF.gif"">

<br>
Hinter jeder Ecke lauert der Wahnsinn auf jene, die es wagen, dem Mythos gegenüberzutreten. Im Zuge Ihrer Ermittlungen werden Sie diverse Situationen erleben, in denen Sie sich entscheiden müssen; treffen Sie die falsche Entscheidung, verlieren Sie nach und nach Ihren Verstand. Sie benötigen Wissen, um die Großen Alten im Kampf zu stellen. Um dieses Wissen zu erlangen, müssen Sie Ihre Umgebung erkunden, doch je mehr Nachforschungen Sie anstellen, desto mehr Dingen werden Sie begegnen, die Ihre geistige Gesundheit zu erschüttern vermögen ... Jene, die unter dem Einfluss des Mythos dem Wahnsinn verfallen, nehmen sich das Leben, um dem ewigen Horror zu entgehen, dem sie nun ins Antlitz blicken müssen. Doch noch ist nicht alle Hoffnung verloren, denn es gibt Methoden, geistige Gesundheit zurückzuerlangen ...

While finding a way to change the flow of past events, you will encounter many obstacles and meet new allies. Will you be brave enough?<br><br>This game aims to revive nostalgic moments for good old RPG fanatics (such as Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy 3...). Our game has no game over screen; once the hero dies, his soul is sent to the underworld, to meet the Soul Giver.

<br />
Mido and Di was a short animation project we wrote but couldn't complete nearly 15 years ago. This game is based on that story, but the story is not playing much part in the game. This is a frantic action, third person, zombie shooting game. You play in simplistic, beautiful looking levels, trying to shoot zombie aliens before they got you. The zombie aliens are coming in waves, like a tower defense game but this is a third person look to that mechanic. You have three different weapons and they are very fun to use. Combining ice and fire weapon, you can even get coins out of zombies. With that coins you upgrade weapons.<br />
<br />
If you are interested to read the story of the animation, here it is (and I will write it like a storyboard concept) :<br />
-Mido is having another nightmare. Objects in his room has changed shape and looks very scary.<br />
-He wakes up. It is another school morning. He waits the school bus. When the bus comes camera goes black.<br />
-Mido returns home from school. He goes to his room and throws his bag with anger.<br />
-He draws a creature to a paper and hangs it on his wall. He names it Di.<br />
-He goes to sleep and he is having another nightmare. But this time, his friend Di, rescues him.<br />
-He wakes up. There is rain outside. He is afraid of thunder but he gets close to window. He opens it.<br />

Nomads of Driftland,,,,"<i>The promise to restore civilization to its former shape and return to the times of splendor overcame sadness. It filled the hearts of Driftland's inhabitants with new hope and energy. Determination for action diverted attention from the numerous conflicts between quarrelsome mage-rulers and various injuries sustained by those who did not give in to their will.
<br>

<br>
Outlaw rebels, by the mage-rulers called <b>Nomads</b>, are exterminated and treated as barbarians. They believe that the new order is an attempt to restore balance in shape that has once destroyed the planet.</i>
<br>

<br>
<b>Now, the Nomads must fight to defend their values and survive.</b><h4>About the game</h4><b>Nomads of Driftland</b> is an RTS game initially created as an add-on to <b>Driftland: The Magic Revival</b>. Since it is significantly different from the base game, we decided to release it as a standalone expansion and make it available for free. 
<br>

<br>
Base game - <b>Driftland: The Magic Revival</b> is a unique fusion of RTS, 4X strategy, and Sim genres in a fantasy world made up of the shattered planet. The player takes on the role of a powerful mage-ruler capable of moving and reshaping parts of the planet. Both game mechanics and history are based on an innovative concept of dynamic topography and issuing orders to individuals with free will.
<br>

With a built-in level editor easily accessible from the main menu creating content is a breeze, it even supports custom model and texture importing!<h2 class=""bb_tag"">A BIT ABOUT US</h2>The first full release from digital design practice Studio Monolith, Polyball is an experiment in low-poly visuals and open-ended game design. Our approach with the project was to make the kind of game we used to play, something that had both casual appeal and a limitless competitive ceiling. It was also a genre that we felt hasn't been adequately adapted to the modern world of game design. Our vision was simple: build a game that's easy to pick up, hard to master, and fun both on and off screen.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">FEATURES</h2><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li> 60+ levels and free DLC<br></li><li> Powerful customization system<br></li><li> Full controller support and keybinding<br></li><li> Splitscreen multiplayer support<br></li><li> Global/Friends Leaderboards<br></li><li> Full soundtrack made by independent artists<br></li><li> Steam Workshop<br></li><li> Tuned mechanics and balanced levels based on community feedback<br></li><li> Mac/Windows/Linux support<br></li><li> Alternate language localization<br></li><li> Ghosts<br></li><li> Steam Cloud Saves<br></li><li> Level editor with custom model support<br></li><li> Stats display<br></li><li> Achievements </li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">MULTIPLAYER MODES</h2><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li> Trails<br></li><li> Battle<br></li><li> Split-Screen + Online Story Mode<br></li><li> More modes coming soon!</li></ul>",Studio Monolith,Studio Monolith,False,False,"Co-Operative, Multiplayer, Single Player",368180,"Indie, Platform, Racing, Simulator",,False,4 Jun 2015,18 Apr 2020 00:00:00,,21 Jul 2022 23:05:13,18 Apr 2020 00:00:00,,Not Played,"Steam:https://store.steampowered.com/app/368180, Official Website:http://polyball.studiomonolith.ca, Twitter:https://twitter.com/studio_monolith",,,PC (Windows),0,0,cb91dfc9-b977-43bf-8e70-55f46e410fab,Steam,,,,80,90,,,1cc8c701-5580-49e7-833c-2730da11ca82

With changing environments as dangerous as they are dynamic, the Mooncrash campaign for Prey will offer a fun, infinitely replayable challenge to test even the most skilled players.</p>
<h2>Story</h2>
<p>In Prey: Mooncrash, TranStar’s secret moon base stopped transmitting shortly after the events of Prey. Now Peter, a hacker stationed aboard a spy satellite tasked with intercepting TranStar communications, must find out why. Trapped and under a ruthless contract with KASMA Corp, Peter’s only hope of ever seeing his family again is uncovering the moon base’s lost secrets.</p>
<h2>Live. Die. Adapt. Escape!</h2>
<p>Escape TranStar’s moon base before the Typhon threat takes over. A simple goal, but one with hundreds of viable solutions. In Mooncrash, players will experience an all-new, infinitely replayable, ‘rogue-lite’ campaign with ever-changing enemies, weapons and objectives against a constantly increasing alien threat.</p>
<h2>Survive How You Want with Who You Want</h2>
<p>Unlock multiple characters as you play, each with their own set of specialized, upgradable skills. Will you forge your path with the resourceful engineer Joan, trade that wrench in for Security Officer Bhatia and his shotgun, or will you choose the frail-but-gifted Andrius and his arsenal of psychic abilities? Prey is about choices, and those choices belong to you.</p>
<h2>Search for Secrets, Loot…and a Way Off</h2>
<p>Arkane Studios’ talent for detail and story-rich environments comes alive in Mooncrash. As you explore the station, which is the same size and scope of four levels of the original game’s Talos I station, don’t forget to keep your eyes peeled for precious supplies – and, of course, Mimics.</p>
<h2>New Challenges, New Solutions</h2>

Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time,,"ESRB T, GRAC 18, PEGI 12",,"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a third-person puzzle-platformer and action-adventure computer and video game published by Ubisoft. It was released on November 21, 2003 and is a reboot of the landmark video game series Prince of Persia, created by Jordan Mechner in 1989.
<br>
<br>The Sands of Time, developed internally at Ubisoft Montreal, successfully captures the mechanics of the original platformer and extends it to the 3D generation. An earlier attempt by The Learning Company to transfer the game to 3D (Prince of Persia 3D) was released in 1999, but despite its initial good reception failed to sell enough and the company responsible for the original trilogy was already closing doors. The game was praised for its visual design, finely tuned game mechanics and intriguing storyline, winning the game several awards.
<br>
<br>The game was developed for the PC, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, and later a 2D-version for the Game Boy Advance and mobile phones. The success of The Sands of Time led to three followups, Prince of Persia: Warrior Within (2004), Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones (2005), and Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands (2010). A remastered, high-definition, version of The Sands of Time was released on the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 on November 16, 2010.",Ubisoft Montreal,"Nintendo, Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc.

<p>Prepare your ears for one of the most intense dynamic soundtracks you have ever heard. Redout enhances your experience and transcends visuals, immersing yourself in a mixture of sounds and music that adapts to your playstyle and your performance on the track.</p>
<h1>Handling</h1>
<p>Control is the most important feeling when you are racing at 800km/h. Redout features believable physics derived from quad-copters controllers and real magnetic forces. We came up with the next generation in AG handling. There's always a way to face a corner without braking, but you have to prepare for it and use everything you've got. Steer, strafe and turbo out of a corner are the basics: upgrades and powerups will grant you even more control on your ship's behaviour.

Seven: Enhanced Edition,,PEGI 18,,"<b>Seven: The Days Long Gone</b> ist ein isometrisches Rollenspiel in einer offenen Welt. Du spielst als Teriel, ein Meisterdieb auf einer Mission, die das Reich Vetrall erschüttern wird. Durchstreife die lebhafte Gefängnisinsel Peh und entscheide dich, ob du ihre zahlreichen Bewohner ausnutzen oder ihnen helfen möchtest.<br><br>

Der eine Ort, den ein Meisterdieb wie Teriel unbedingt meiden würde, ist zweifelsohne die Gefängnisinsel Peh. Doch nachdem ein gewagter Raubüberfall eine unerwartete Wendung nimmt, findet sich Teriel gefesselt auf einem Luftschiff wieder, das auf dem Weg zu eben dieser berüchtigten Insel ist. Schlimmer noch: Der Dämon in seinem Kopf lässt keinen Zweifel daran, dass er nie entkommen wird, wenn er seinen Befehlen nicht genau folgt.<br><br>

Du spielst in Seven: The Days Long Gone als Teriel. Du musst deine gesamte List einsetzen und im Verborgenen bleiben, um aus einem Netz der Täuschung und des Verrats zu entrinnen und die Insel Peh letztlich zu überleben.

<br><br>

<b><h4>ERKUNDE EINE OFFENE, LEBHAFTE WELT AUS DER ISOMETRISCHEN PERSPEKTIVE</b></h4> Sobald du auf Peh ankommst, kannst du dich auf der Insel frei bewegen. Schleiche, renne, klettere und kämpfe dich durch diverse Umgebungen. Du kannst dich umsehen, wo du willst – lediglich Kontrollpunkte, monsterverseuchte Bereiche und gefährliche Fraktionen halten dich davon ab!
<b><h4>WÄHLE DEINEN SPIELSTIL</b></h4>  Als Meisterdieb weiß Teriel, wie man im Verborgenen agiert. Überrumple Gegner von hinten und von oben, führ sie mit listigen Verkleidungen auf den Leim oder nutze die Umgebung, um ganz unbemerkt zu bleiben. Wenn jedoch etwas schief- oder dir die Geduld ausgeht, hält dich nichts davon ab, eine Reihe verheerender Waffen und tödliche Magiefähigkeiten auf deine Feinde loszulassen.
<b><h4>LERNE ZAHLREICHE VIELFÄLTIGE CHARAKTERE KENNEN</b></h4>  Du triffst auf eine Menge Leute, von verzweifelten Sklaven und Gefangenen bis hin zu den Reichen und Schönen. Beachte dabei nur die zwei wichtigen Fraktionen auf Peh: die Biomancers und die Technomagi. An so einem Ort der Verzweiflung gibt es viele, die alle Hilfe in Anspruch nehmen, die sie kriegen können. Entscheide dich, ob du den Bewohnern Pehs helfen oder sie ausnutzen willst, aber denk daran, dass es in jedem Fall Konsequenzen gibt.
<b><h4>ENTDECKE EINE EPISCHE GESCHICHTE ÜBER VERRAT UND TÄUSCHUNG</b></h4> Auf Peh kocht jeder sein eigenes Süppchen, und der Schein trügt oft. Tauche ab in diese Welt voller Misstrauen, die von den Intrigen mächtiger Parteien zermürbt wird. Arbeite mit dem Dämon zusammen, der dich besessen hat, um eine äußerst wichtige Mission abzuschließen.

<b>Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director’s Cut Features:</b>
<br><br>
<b>A Classic, Story-Driven cRPG</b>: See why PC Gamer hailed Dragonfall as “one of the most memorable and complex RPG stories of the decade.” Dragonfall hearkens back to the golden age of computer RPG’s with a novel-like branching narrative full of sharp prose and deep character development. Immerse yourself in a smart, 20+ hour campaign with a diverse cast of all-too-human characters.
<br><br>
<b>A One-of-a-Kind Cyberpunk Setting</b>: Experience the unique “Tech meets Magic” dystopian future of Shadowrun, a fan-favorite game setting now celebrating it’s 25th anniversary. Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director’s Cut is the perfect entry point to the setting for those with no prior Shadowrun experience, while providing plenty of classic Shadowrun characters and tech for veteran players to sink their teeth into.
<br><br>
<b>Command Your Team</b>: Lead a small team of shadowrunners - each with their own outlook, motivations, and backstory. The members of your team are designed to play contrasting roles during missions, and each has a distinct set of skills, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. But it’s not all about the mission - each team member also has challenges to face in their own lives, which you can choose to brush aside or play an important part in.
<br><br>
<b>Gripping, Turn-Based Tactical Combat</b>: When you’re running the shadows, every turn matters. Choose your actions wisely - move to better cover, charge into melee, or lob a fireball into a crowd of enemies. With over 200 weapons and spells at your disposal, every turn is filled with meaningful choices.
<br><br>
<b>Skill-Based Character Progression</b>: Choose a starting character archetype and build from there! Street Samurai and Physical Adepts use advanced combat skills to dominate the battlefield, Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells, while Riggers and Deckers provide critical technological support, projecting their consciousness directly into drones and computer systems. Shadowrun: Dragonfall’s classless skill system allows you to grow your character in any direction you choose.
<br><br>
<b>New in the Director’s Cut:</b>
<br><br>
<b>Standalone</b>: Due to popular demand, Dragonfall is now a completely standalone title!
<br><br>
<b>Five All-New Missions</b>: The Director’s Cut features five all-new original missions, including three related directly to the personal stories of your team members. These missions take you to previously-unseen locales - both within the Flux State and beyond - where you’ll have to face challenging enemies and make tough choices in order to help your team members prevail.
<br><br>
<b>Revamped Combat System</b>: The Dragonfall combat system has received a major overhaul. An all-new armor system adds another tactical layer to the experience, while refined cover and damage mechanics emphasize the importance of battlefield positioning. Complementing these improvements is an upgraded AI system which reacts more intelligently and accurately to your actions.
<br><br>
Redesigned Interface: The Dragonfall in-game interface has also been rebuilt. Spells, items and abilities are now much easier to access, while improved combat feedback allows you to fully understand the tactical situation in any given encounter.
<br><br>
<b>Customize Your Team</b>: Guide your team members as they progress in each of their unique roles, choosing between different focus options to grant them new items and abilities. In addition, if you don’t like a team member’s default spell, item or weapon loadout, you can now customize what they bring on each mission.
<br><br>
<b>Ten New Pieces of Original Music</b>: Fan-favorite composer Jon Everist brings ten new tracks of moody cyberpunk music to the Dragonfall experience, including compositions based on the stories of individual members of your team.
<br><br>
<b>The Complete Dragonfall Soundtrack</b>: As a free bonus, the Director’s Cut includes the entire soundtracks from both Dragonfall AND our previous title, Shadowrun Returns. This also includes the brand new tracks exclusive to the Director’s Cut. Featuring music from the composers of the classic Shadowrun SEGA and SNES games, this exciting cyberpunk soundtrack pays homage to the past with a modern sentiment.

<p><strong>London, 1888.</strong> After a decade of war with the Lunar invaders we named the Selenites, the British Empire finally vanquished the insect-like menace thanks to a dashing officer by the name of Hugo Wells. He crushed the colony’s queen and in doing so cemented his status as both a hero of the empire, and the de facto patriarch of the drone-like Selenites.</p>
<p>Following the war, the Selenites became the new workforce of our industrial revolution, ushering in a new era of progress and prosperity. Freed from the shackles of employment, man could pursue more earthly endeavors. However, listlessness and disobedience rampaged throughout the middle and working classes. In order to satiate the masses, Hugo Wells conceived of the ultimate entertainment. An elite sport where only the bravest, the fastest and the most worthy warriors could wage a petty war against the enslaved Selenite hordes. Welcome… to Speed Brawl!</p>

This narratively-driven, single-player game puts you in the role of a Jedi Padawan who narrowly escaped the purge of Order 66 following the events of <i>Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith</i>. On a quest to rebuild the Jedi Order, you must pick up the pieces of your shattered past to complete your training, develop new powerful Force abilities and master the art of the iconic lightsaber – all while staying one step ahead of the Empire and its deadly Inquisitors. 
<br>
<br>
While mastering your abilities, players will engage in cinematically-charged lightsaber and Force combat designed to deliver the kind of intense <i>Star Wars</i> lightsaber battles as seen in the films.

KEY FEATURES

<br>
●<b>Cinematic, Immersive Combat</b> – Jedi: Fallen Order delivers the fantasy of becoming a Jedi through its innovative lightsaber combat system – striking, parrying, dodging – partnered with a suite of powerful Force abilities you’ll need to leverage to overcome obstacles that stand in your way. This combat system is intuitive to pick up but takes training and practice to fully master its nuances as you gain new powers and abilities along your adventure.
<br>
<br>
●<b>A New Jedi Story Begins</b> – As a former Padawan on the run from the Empire, you must complete your training before Imperial Inquisitors discover your plan to revive the Jedi Order. Aided by a former Jedi Knight, a cantankerous pilot and a fearless droid, you must escape the evil machinations of the Empire in a story-driven adventure. Explore and overcome a wide range of challenges focused on combat, exploration and puzzle-solving.
<br>
<br>
●<b>The Galaxy Awaits</b> – Ancient forests, windswept rock faces and haunted jungles are all unique biomes you’ll explore in Jedi: Fallen Order, with the freedom to decide when and where you go next. As you unlock new powers and abilities, opportunities open up to re-traverse maps in new ways, leveraging the Force to augment the way you explore. Move quickly, however, as the Empire is actively hunting your every step in their effort to exterminate all remnants of the Jedi Order.

Dein Motorrad ist deine Waffe, mit der du deine Gegner auf fantastische, stylishe Weise zu Altmetall verarbeiten kannst, während du hoch, runter, links und rechts über Dächer und durch von Gegnern besetzte Tunnel heist.<h4><h4><b>Inhalte</b></h4></h4><h4><i>Rasen, schießen, Stunts – alles im Preis inbegriffen!</i></h4><img src=""https://items.gog.com/steel_rats/ride_Shoot_stunt_final.gif"" >

Je kreativer du bei deinen Zerstörungsaktionen bist, desto besser: Fahre Wände hoch, schlage Rückwärtssaltos an Gebäudewänden und lasse Chaos hinabregnen, während du über Kopf fährst.<h4><i>Boosten und erkunden</i></h4><img src=""https://items.gog.com/steel_rats/dashandexplore.gif"" >

Stray Gods: The Roleplaying Musical,,PEGI 12,,"<img src=""https://items.gog.com/stray_gods_the_roleplaying_musical/StrayGods_Header.png"" />
<br>
In a modern fantasy world, college dropout Grace is granted the power of a Muse - power she’ll need to find out the truth behind her predecessor’s death before time runs out. You’ll decide who Grace allies with, who she can trust, and who may betray her in this beautifully hand-illustrated roleplaying musical.
<br>

<br>
Written by David Gaider comes Stray Gods - an urban fantasy tale of finding your place, taking charge of your fate, and discovering answers. Your choices will change the endings, as well as the path you take to get there.
<br>

<br>
<i>A compelling story of hope, self-discovery, and forging your path.</i>

Super Meat Boy Forever,,PEGI 12,,"Meat Boy and Bandage Girl have grown as a couple since 2010. It seems like only yesterday the two love birds were escaping from an exploding laboratory in the sky. Now it’s the current year, and they’ve welcomed their daughter Nugget into the world. Their peaceful days enjoying life as a family came to an abrupt end when Dr. Fetus beat the snot out of them with a rusty shovel, and kidnapped Nugget! Now it’s up to Meat Boy and Bandage Girl to rescue their daughter from a lunatic fetus in a jar that can only be described as an incel version of Tony Stark.
<br>
<br>- Super Meat Boy Forever is the sequel to Super Meat Boy! This is a new experience that eclipses the original. Don’t stare directly at it unless you still have your eclipse glasses.
<br>- 7200 individually handcrafted levels combine dynamically to give you a new challenge every single time you play. Seven thousand two hundred levels. They said we couldn’t do it, but we did. Who’s they? Don’t ask. They don’t like it when you ask.
<br>- It’s hard, but fair. Nothing in life worth having comes easy. Just ask Dark Soulman.
<br>- Meat Boy and Bandage Girl can fight back. It’s time to unleash the raw fury of parenthood on their foes just like Liam Neeson in that documentary about his family vacation in Paris.
<br>- Bigger boss battles than before. Your mind will be blown. Your socks will be blown off. Team Meat is not liable for any of this.
<br>- Brand new art with stunning detail and resolution. There are a lot of pixels in here. Grab the biggest display you have and watch those dots change color rapidly with gumption. Don’t sit too close though. (If your parents aren’t home you can sit as close as you want we won’t tell, but Team Meat is still not liable for any of this.)
<br>- A soundtrack composed by Ridiculon so intense that the state of Wyoming has issued a ban on all audio devices capable of playing it out of fear that just a single note will cause the dormant super volcano beneath Yellowstone to erupt ushering in a new age of darkness.
<br>- Frame by frame artisan crafted in game animations, and animated cutscenes that will make you experience procedurally generated emotions.

Surviving Mars,,"ESRB E10, PEGI 7",,"<h2>Colonize Mars and discover her secrets, with minimal casualties.</h2>
<p>Welcome Home! The time has come to stake your claim on the Red Planet and build the first functioning human colonies on Mars! All you need are supplies, oxygen, decades of training, experience with sandstorms, and a can-do attitude to discover the purpose of those weird black cubes that appeared out of nowhere. With a bit of sprucing up, this place is going to be awesome!</p>
<p>Surviving Mars is a sci-fi city builder all about colonizing Mars and surviving the process. Choose a space agency for resources and financial support before determining a location for your colony. Build domes and infrastructure, research new possibilities and utilize drones to unlock more elaborate ways to shape and expand your settlement. Cultivate your own food, mine minerals or just relax by the bar after a hard day’s work. Most important of all, though, is keeping your colonists alive. Not an easy task on a strange new planet.</p>
<p>There will be challenges to overcome. Execute your strategy and improve your colony’s chances of survival while unlocking the mysteries of this alien world. Are you ready? Mars is waiting for you.</p>
<h2>Main Features:</h2>
<p>Building a sustainable colony in space
Building on a planet not fit for human life challenges you to build a smart, functional colony. Bad planning isn’t about traffic jams, it’s about survival of your colonists. You really don’t want rolling blackouts in a city constructed in a place without oxygen.</p>
<p>Individually simulated colonists
Each colonist is a unique individual with problems and strengths that influence the needs and behavior of the other colonists. Things can get really interesting if your chief scientists develops alcoholism after one too many long nights in the lab.</p>
<p>Futuristic Space Dome construction
Retro-futuristic super structures housing colonists, factories and commercial buildings with their own “neighborhood personality.” Create colonies that value science over everything else, while tired workers drink their pay away at a local bar, or attempt a utopia among the stars.</p>
<p>Exploration of Mars’ secrets
Inspired by the classic sci-fi of Asimov and Clarke, Surviving Mars holds many secrets. During each playthrough players may encounter one of Mars’ individually crafted mysteries. Uncovering these secrets might bring your colony great fortune, or terrible ruin. What is that sphere that manifested itself outside colony HUB B, and is it friendly?</p>
<p>Randomized research tree
Combine static and random research through experimentation, which allows for a different experience for each journey through the game. Attain new scientific breakthroughs by exploring the uncharted terrain of Mars's surface.</p>

Syndicate Plus,,ESRB T,,"In the dark and twisted cities of tomorrow, corporate syndicates compete for global dominance. But the boardroom deals and corporate takeovers of the future look very different from today: they are lead by marketing directors who manage teams of half-men, half-machine cyborgs with no conscience and plenty of guns.
<br><br>
You are an ambitious marketing director in the Syndicate, hand-picked to lead a team of cyborg mercenaries. You work in the problem-solving department and you are damn good at ""taking care"" of problems. Some might say that violence is not the answer but you know better. There here are hardly any problems that you can't solve with a well-placed bullet. Collateral damage in the local population and infrastructure during the “negotiations” is, as always, acceptable. After all, what would you expect form the dystopian futuristic world run by mega-corporations?
<br><br>
Syndicate is Bullfrog’s masterpiece of a game in which you aren’t saving the world or protecting innocents. You just make sure that your employers get what they want. At your disposal are four cyborg agents, an impressive arsenal of weapons and gadgets, and a massive selection of cybernetic upgrades. You are free to unleash this power on a highly interactive map where you can blow up buildings, steal cars, light trees on fire, or just shoot stuff. Produced by Peter Molyneux himself, Syndicate is the essence of cyberpunk and, with its great music, stylized visuals, and mind-blowing atmosphere, it has earned its place among the best games of all time. Make sure to check out the game that secured Bullfrog's place in game development hall of fame.

Players will be able to master a range of authentically modelled equipment brought to the field by Russian Frontovik and Cossack squads, the renowned Latvian Riflemen, or the Roumanian infantry squad.

Sie bauen Trauben verschiedener Sorten an, kreieren Ihre eigenen Weine, verwalten Ihr Gut und bauen es nach und nach weiter aus. Dabei müssen Sie Faktoren wie das Wetter und andere zufällige Ereignisse berücksichtigen und Ihren Betrieb entsprechend einstellen.<h4>Features</h4>
Zu den Features und Spielmechaniken zählen:
<br>

<br>
<ul class=""bb_ul""><li> Große Auswahl verschiedener Rebsorten, die jeweils unterschiedliche Ansprüche stellen.
<br>
</li><li> Dynamisches Wettersystem, welches das unberechenbare Wetter in der realen Welt simuliert.
<br>
</li><li> Jeder vollständige Durchgang umfasst 60 Jahre im Spiel, doch Sie können auch dann noch weiterspielen, ohne allerdings zusätzliche Punkte zu sammeln.
<br>
</li><li> Erschaffen Sie Ihre eigenen Wein-Kreationen in vier klassischen Schritten: Keltern, Gärung, Maischen und Reifung.  Jede Rebsorte muss auf eine ganz bestimmte Art und Weise hergestellt werden, um die besten Ergebnisse zu erzielen, weshalb Sie jede davon erlernen und meistern müssen.
<br>
</li><li> Sie fangen das Spiel mit einem einzigen Hexfeld für den Anbau an und erweitern Ihr Weingut dann auf bis zu 33 Hexfelder, wobei sechs verschiedene Typen zur Auswahl stehen. Manche Felder beeinflussen die Felder in ihrer Umgebung, weshalb eine strategische Planung unerlässlich ist.
<br>
</li><li> Und natürlich können Sie Ihr Weingut mit Deko-Objekten noch verschönern.
<br>
</li><li> ZUFALL & RISIKO: Zufallsereignisse und Missionen bei Terroir. Sie können die Wunderkiste öffnen und sich zwischen ZUFALL (einem Zufallsereignis mit positiven oder negativen Folgen) und RISIKO (einer Mission, für deren Abschluss es eine Belohnung gibt, Versagen aber mit einer Strafe geahndet wird) entscheiden.
<br>
</li><li> Treten Sie bei Wettbewerben an, um den Marktwert Ihres Weines und den Ruf Ihres Weinguts zu verbessern.
<br>
</li><li> Klares, minimalistisches Design und wunderschöne 3-D-Modelle im Low-Poly-Look.
<br>
</li><li> Original-Soundtrack komponiert und eingespielt vom CLARQuinet-Ensemble aus Singapur.</li></ul>
<br>
Also, nichts wie los, ziehen Sie Ihre Handschuhe an, schnappen Sie sich Ihre Gartenschere und bauen Sie von Grund auf Ihr eigenes Chateau. Viel Glück, Prost und zum Wohl!

It has been a long road. However, all stories must come to an end.<br><br>

This War of Mine has been giving you a thrilling experience of living through the war as a civilian for five years since its release. Numerous updates and expansions have broadened the experience and filled it with more shades and tonalities of hard civilian existence during wartime. Now, honoring the 5th anniversary of the original release, 11 bit studios proudly presents to you This War of Mine: Final Cut.
<br><br>
This War of Mine: Final Cut contains all the updates and free expansions released so far and introduces not only a new scenario but also expands all scenarios with the locations known from Stories DLCs - even if you don’t own those. In short words - that means you can now experience lots of never-seen-before playthroughs and struggle with new challenges.
<br><br>
<b>Major changes and new content:</b>
<ul>
<li>One new classic scenario</li>
<li>All locations from TWoM Stories added to the original game</li>
<li>New quests and Events on Stories locations</li>
<li>Remastered versions of all the classic locations</li>

<h4>About This War Of Mine:</h4>

In This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle.
<br><br>
The pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive.
<br><br>
Make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better.

<h4>This War of Mine - main features:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Inspired by real-life events</li>
<li>Control your survivors and manage your shelter</li>
<li>Craft weapons, alcohol, beds or stoves – anything that helps you survive</li>
<li>Make decisions - an often unforgiving and emotionally difficult experience</li>
<li>Randomized world and characters every time you start a new game</li>
<li>Charcoal-stylized aesthetics to complement the game's theme</li>

deeply. She’s become a darker, hardened, imperious version of herself. A
desperate phone call from her former mentor Von Croy leads her to Paris.
But as she arrives, she discovers that the old man was brutally murdered
and a plot to frame her for his death is in motion. Avoiding the people
pursuing her, she needs to clear her name and unravel the mystery of an
ominous medieval order of alchemists and mystics. Surprisingly, she doesn’t
have to take on the world by herself this time. Lara’s kindred spirit, an
adventurer by the name of Kurtis Trent, is there to offer a helping hand.
But can he be trusted?

Treasure Adventure Game,,,,"This game was clearly made with passion. You can see the proof of this almost everywhere. The 2D environments are colorful and enchanting, gameplay feels smooth and polished, not to mention the absolutely huge and very diversified world in which you can spend many hours just exploring. Treasure Adventure Game casts you in the role of a young boy who lands on an island that is a fragment of what was once a continent, destroyed in the war between a demon and a wizard. You accept quests, travel across the oceans, and generally have a bang-up time of being a little boy in a big world, out there looking for treasure and adventure. Your equipment consists of a hat, a parrot, and a boat that appears whenever you touch water. Combine those with the basic platforming abilities like jumping and crawling that you’re familiar with from every platforming game ever, and you’ve got the basics of a phenomenal romp across a huge world filled with treasure, maps, secrets, danger, and triumph.
<br><br>
The music changes with the environments and day-night cycles, enhancing the feel the game is evoking and making you feel immersed in the world as you travel through it. The game has a retro feel, yes, but you really have to see it for yourself to understand what Treasure Adventure Game brings to the table. Since it’s free, of course, there is simply no reason not to!
<br><br>

<i><b>»Trüberbrook« is a thrilling mystery-sci-fi adventure game.</b></i> 
<br>
Enjoy an adventurous vacation to a 1960's parallel universe! A Sci-Fi-Mystery Adventure Game with handmade scenery.
<br>

<br>
Imagine yourself on a vacation to Europe in the late sixties. Now, picture yourself as a young American scientist; Hans Tannhauser. Yes, that's your name in this scenario. While you're at it, think of Trüberbrook, a remote village in rural, mountain-sloped and densely forested cold-war Germany. Because, that's where you somehow end up after hitting the continent. But who cares, you won the trip in a lottery! Or at least, that’s how it seems. But don't fear, instead of getting some rest, you could find yourself having to save the world …

<img src=""https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/en/story.png"">

<br>
<b>The year is 1967.</b> The world policy is dominated by the Cold War and Vietnam, Russia and America are racing to the moon. At the same time in Europe, students take to the streets from Paris to Berlin.
<br>

<br>
On a larger scale, the world is locked in turmoil, but most people are unaware of the events unfolding in an overlooked, sleepy part in the German province. <b>Hans Tannhauser</b>, an American student in his late twenties is caught by surprise: Out of the blue, he wins a trip to a small, German village, <b>Trüberbrook</b>. Truber-what? No idea! It doesn’t help he can’t remember taking part in any lottery in the first place … Happy to put some distance between him and his Ph.D. in quantum physics, he makes his way to Trüberbrook, Germany, bursting with curiosity.
<br>

<br>
But shortly after his arrival, inexplicable things start to happen: A mysterious stranger breaks into his room at the Guesthouse Waldeslust and steals a paper on physics. But who would do that? And why?
<br>

<br>
Gradually, he gets to know the various villagers and spa guests, one more peculiar than the other. Only young anthropologist Greta Lemke, who is on a research trip to Trüberbrook, seems normal to him. Before he knows it, Greta becomes Tannhauser’s accomplice on the <b>adventure of a lifetime</b>! It slowly dawns on the aspiring physicist that his presence in Tüberbrook is not accidental – he is here to save the world!

<br>
As the story proceeds, Tannhauser teams up with <b>Greta Lemke</b>, a student of paleoanthropology, and bumps into the enigmatic inventor <b>Lazarus Taft</b>.
<br>

<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/tb_tannhauser.png"">

<br>
<b>Hans Tannhauser</b> is an American physics student in his mid-twenties – and a clever one at that. The adorable little fellow is well-read, always curious and of a deeply friendly nature.
<br>

<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/tb_gretchen.png"">

<br>
<b>Greta Lemke</b> was always the fiercest kid in the sandbox; cute but merciless if someone dared interrupting her excavations of twig bones and toy artefacts. The somewhat overenthusiastic student of paleoanthropology arrives in Trüberbrook on an adventure to unravel the mysteries surrounding the village.
<br>

<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/tb_taft.png"">

<br>
As much a reclusive inventor as it gets, <b>Lazarus Taft</b> quickly became talk of the town due to his superior card playing. There must be a reason he bought this costly old mansion in Trüberbrook, of all places … What's up with Lazarus Taft?
<br>

<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/tb_ensemble.png"">

<br>
Trüberbrook is full of quirky villagers, tourists and strangers – like the gruffy but warm-hearted innkeeper Trude or her daughter Leni, ""the weird kid"" from Trüberbrook Elementary. And there's the old baron, a veteran of two world wars, or Lessing, the prototype of modern day conspiracists. And of course Trübi, the legendary lake monster. To name a few.
<br>

<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/en/handcrafted-scenery.png"">

<br>
One of the most distinctive features of the game is the unique visual style. The sceneries are purely handmade. 'Handmade' as in: 'Manufactured using real hands!' And fingers!
<br>

<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/gif_1.jpg"">

<br>
Not the most efficient way of doing things, but certainly the most inefficient one. We're loving it, though! Look at what we do here, piece by piece, by the sweat of our brows. Every little detail is custom-made.
<br>

<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/gif_4.jpg"">

<br>
The models are digitized using a technique called photogrammetry and later retopologized. This way we get highly detailed polygon models that blend perfectly with our digital characters.
<br>

<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/gif_5.jpg"">

<br>
It is a lot of work, but also quite exciting! You may ask yourself, how can they reach this level of detail? Are there very tiny people involved? They can't accomplish all of this with mere human hands, right? Well yes, we can! The answer might be our abundance of professional hands. Twenty-four seven at our disposal in all shapes and colors, they get things done!
<br>

<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/gif_8.jpg"">

<br>
Every scene gets an individual treatment and is staged with actual physical lighting. This allows us to simulate different hours of the day or weather conditions. Even a change of seasons is possible just by redecorating the set with real tiny little snowflakes, no joke.
<br>

<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/gif_6.jpg"">

<br>
This way we achieve an exceptional and magical look that visually reflects the world of Trüberbrook.
<br>

<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/en/gameplay.png"">

<br>
Trüberbrook is a story-driven adventure game with a strong focus on characters and the narrative, but includes a lot of puzzles that need to be solved to progress the story. The puzzles are designed to integrate into the narrative.
<br>

<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/gameplay_1.jpg"">

<br>
You navigate Tannhauser through the different sceneries from a third person perspective, usually in long distance shots to intensify the impression of peeking into a little diorama. The story unfolds as you interact with your environment, talk to other characters and solve puzzles. These range from inventory-based puzzles to social challenges (such as persuading other characters) up to passing unsettling psycho tests.
<br>

<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/gameplay_3.jpg"">

<br>
For the console versions, we came up with a very intuitive controller input, allowing you to move the line of sight and walking directions independently. For the PC versions, you can choose between classic point and click mouse controls, and the controller navigation.
<br>

<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/en/soundtrack.png"">

<br>
The soundtrack of Trüberbrook is an original composition to fit the mood of the game – sort of a tranquil doom jazz. Inspirations come from the works of <i>Tom Waits</i>, <i>Angelo Badalamenti</i>, <i>Mark Lanegan</i>, <i>Timber Timbre</i> or <i>Bohren & der Club of Gore</i>. The soundtrack is directed by Sebastian Nagel & Albrecht Schrader.
<br>

<br>
<img src=""https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/en/localization.png"">

<br>
We've spent a lot of time working on a voice acting concept that joins in with the genetic code of the game. Since the protagonist is an American in the midst of a bunch of Germans, we wanted to reflect this in our choice of actors: In the international English audio, the main character Tannhauser speaks native American English, while all of the townspeople of Trüberbrook sport genuine German accents!

Create massive battles with absolutely no limits. Want to see 10,000 chickens fight an army of Romans?? Sure, why not. Want to see a company of WW2 U.S soldiers fight 11,000 Medieval soldiers?? There are simply no limits to the carnage you can achieve in Epic Battle Simulator. Mess around with a massive variety of units. Everything from, Roman Centurions, Medieval soldiers, Knights, Orcs, Trolls, and yes, chickens! The main focus in this game is giving the player no restrictions to what he can do. That is why we decided not to limit the amount of units in battle. Want to see what a battle of 100,000 units looks like? We don't recommend going past 10,000 for most machines but its your CPU, do what you want! On top of that, you can play as any one of the units in the game, getting up close and personal to help change the tides of a massive battle, while rallying teammates and giving them orders!<br><br>The Technology:<br><br>Unfortunately there really aren't many engines that you can chuck 10,000 characters in and expect good performance. This is why I worked months on end to create the most powerful crowd rendering system ever conceived in Unity engine. The detail of each character has little effect on performance while each individual acts independently, but is working towards a greater good for his team.  Each individual decides his own path and navigates complex environments. But I didn't stop there! With the large open environments, I needed a more dynamic lighting solution than the one built in to Unity engine. So I built my own dynamic global illumination lighting engine. This enables bounce light completely in real time. What does that mean? That means every piece of shiny armor is reflecting it's true surroundings, every bright surfaces illuminates it's surroundings and effects the overall lighting. <br><br>Yes I worked hard to bring this game to life, may you all inflict carnage upon it!",Brilliant Game Studios,Brilliant Game Studios,False,False,Single Player,616560,"Adventure, Indie, Simulator, Strategy",,False,12 Apr 2017,29 Jan 2021 00:00:00,,21 Jul 2022 23:05:35,29 Jan 2021 00:00:00,,Not Played,"Youtube:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV0vQTkEQrF1NLQnRWwR6_A, Steam:https://store.steampowered.com/app/616560, Official Website:https://www.brilliantgamestudios.com/",,,PC (Windows),0,0,cb91dfc9-b977-43bf-8e70-55f46e410fab,Steam,,,,60,45,,,2a5245ad-c2f1-4c34-9be2-a433c5962e95

<p>Verdun is the first multiplayer FPS set in a realistic World War One setting, and is the game which started the WW1 Game series. The vicious close quarters nature of trench warfare means that skill with a bayonet can be as vital as good aim with a rifle. Other games in the series include Tannenberg, set on the Eastern Front, and the upcoming Isonzo, featuring mountain warfare set on the Italian Front.</p>
<h1>Key Features</h1>
<ul>
<li>Experience World War One gameplay: Accurate weaponry, poisonous gas with a claustrophobic gas mask experience, horrendous gore effects, and ferocious artillery barrages</li>
<li>Tactical squad-based FPS: 15 distinctive squad types representing soldiers from 5+ countries, each with distinct weapons and equipment</li>
<li>True trench warfare: Real-time dynamic frontline with momentum based attack and counter-attack gameplay</li>
<li>Authentic World War 1 setting: Typical WW1 music and style, historical battlefields representing the key theaters on the Western Front</li>
</ul>
<h1>Game Modes</h1>
<p>The game offers 5 distinct game-modes with many historically accurate features such as realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on the real battlefields of France and Belgium. The dynamic Frontlines game mode features 64 players taking turns to go over the top and attempt to capture the opposing trench line.</p>
<h1>Authentic WW1 Combat</h1>
<p>The gameplay in this true WW1 battlefield experience is as immersive and gritty as it can get, with features such as optional realistic gore which portrays the true horror of the First World War and authentic weaponry including artillery and gas. Weapons need to be handled with skill - each gun handles differently and there are no floating crosshairs to aid your aim, along with realistic bullet physics to contend with.</p>
<p>Keep your head down or quickly don your mask in the event of artillery strikes or gas attacks. This unforgiving war isn’t for the faint hearted!</p>
<h1>Extensive Research</h1>
<p>For Verdun, we carried out extensive field research at the battlefield itself and were advised by knowledgeable historians to make sure the individual elements in Verdun are as historically accurate as it can get. Uniforms have been recreated to the tiniest detail, the weapons are modeled to exact references and the maps use realistic props and terrain layouts. Everything has been tailored to recreate the grim atmosphere so typical of WW1, from the immersive interface and war torn maps to realistic sounds and voices that evoke the feeling of actually being there in the muddy trenches.</p>

In einer nicht allzu fernen Zukunft gewann eine künstliche Intelligenz die Oberhand über alle anderen KIs und ihre Regierungen. Die Gesellschaft ist in eine permanente integrierte Realität migriert, die mit einem einzigen neuronalen Netzwerk verbunden ist, das ihre Erfahrungen durch die Verarbeitung persönlicher Daten ständig optimiert.<br>
<br>
Nathan, ein Außenseiter, der sich immer noch weigert, sich dem neuen System zu unterwerfen, verdient seinen Lebensunterhalt als Schmuggler von modifizierter Hardware und geknackter Software abseits des Netzes. Ausgerüstet mit seinem individuellen Headset gehört er zu den wenigen, die AVR noch abschalten und die Realität als das sehen können, was sie ist. Er teilt sich eine Wohnung in der Stadt mit seiner Freundin Jay, einer talentierten AVR-Graffitikünstlerin, deren Drohnen Techno-Farbe über den ganzen augmentierten Raum in der Stadt sprühen.<br>
<br>
Als Nathan eines Tages aufwacht, stellt er fest, dass Jay über Nacht verschwunden ist, sein Headset kaputt ist und eine kryptische Nachricht auf dem Badezimmerspiegel hinterlassen wurde. Abgeschnitten und entschlossen, herauszufinden, was mit Jay passiert ist, findet er sich auf einer unerwarteten Reise wieder, an der Jays Hackergruppe und eine Gilde von AVR-Technomancern beteiligt sind.<br>
<br>
Auf seiner Reise um die Welt muss er über Hardware-Friedhöfe gehen, sich mit digitaler Archäologie, Stämmen von Kryptoschamanen und Ausschweifungen in die virtuelle Realität auseinandersetzen.

Void Bastards,,"ESRB M, PEGI 16",,"<p>Forget everything you know about first-person shooters: Void Bastards asks you to take charge, not just point your gun and fire. Your task is to lead the rag-tag Void Bastards out of the Sargasso Nebula. You make the decisions: where to go, what to do and who to fight. And then you must carry out that strategy in the face of strange and terrible enemies.</p>
<p>On board derelict spaceships you’ll plan your mission, taking note of the ship layout, what hazards and enemies you might encounter and what terminals and other ship systems you can use to your advantage..</p>
<p>Move carefully through the dangerous ships, searching for supplies and manipulating control systems. React to what you find - will you detour to the generator to bring the power back online or will you fight your way into the security module to disable the ship’s defenses? Choose carefully when to fight, when to run and when just to be a bastard.</p>
<p>Use your hard won supplies to improvise tools and weapons, from the distracting robo-kitty to the horribly unstable clusterflak.</p>
<p>Navigate your tiny escape pod through the vast nebula. Flee from void whales and pirates, and politely avoid the hungry hermits. All the while you must keep scavenging for the food, fuel, and other resources that keep you alive.</p>
<p>Void Bastards features a 12-15 hour campaign that you can complete with an endless supply of prisoners, each with their own unique traits. When one dies, another steps forward to carry on the fight. Don’t worry though, as any crafting progress you’ve made is retained from one to another.</p>

<p>As you explore, you'll encounter strange and unsettling things: slices of a country built on dust clouds and murky dreams, where the folk tales are bleeding through. You'll carry those tales with you, swapping them round campfires to make the cast of characters open up to you and share their own stories.</p>
<p><em>&quot;The greatest stories are the true ones; the ones people will tell you about their own lives&quot;</em></p>
<p>The stories you share will return to you along your journey, changed in the telling as they've made their way around the country. As you meet the characters time and again on your travels, they will grow to trust you and, hopefully, share their true selves with you. Only by learning all their real stories can you pay off your debt.</p>
<ul>
<li>Beautiful combination of 3D overworld and hand drawn 2D illustrations</li>
<li>Original stories written by a wide selection of accomplished authors</li>
<li>Fully voiced characters from all walks of life brought to life by world-renowned voice acting talent, including Sting, Dave Fennoy (The Walking Dead: A Telltale Game Series), Cissy Jones (Firewatch), Kimberly Brooks (Mass Effect), Sarah Elmaleh (Gone Home), Melissa Hutchison (The Walking Dead: A Telltale Game Series), Elizabeth Maxwell (The Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild), and many more.</li>
<li>A hauntingly beautiful original soundtrack arranged by celebrated composer Ryan Ike and featuring performances from a collection of gifted musicians.</li>

while True: learn(),,,,"<h1>About this game</h1>
<p><strong>while True: learn()</strong> is a puzzle/simulation game about even more puzzling stuff: machine learning, neural networks, big data and AI. But most importantly, it’s about understanding your cat.</p>
<p>In this game, you play as a coder who accidentally found out that their cat is extremely good at coding, but not as good at speaking human language. Now this coder (it’s you!) must learn all there is to know about machine learning and use visual programming to build a cat-to-human speech recognition system.</p>
<h1>This game fits best for...</h1>
<ul>
<li>People who want to know more about how machine learning and related technologies work</li>
<li>Parents and teachers who are looking for a fun and easy way to make an intro to logical thinking, programming, and technologies for kids</li>
<li>Players who like to keep their brains busy and working in different ways, while still having fun</li>
<li>Gamers looking to improve their problem-solving skills and feel immense sense of satisfaction and achievement that comes along with it</li>
<li>People who like smart cats</li>
</ul>
<h1>Learn how machine learning works in real life!</h1>
<p>The game is loosely based on real-life machine learning technologies: from goofy Expert Systems to mighty Recurrent Neural Networks, capable of predicting the future. Don’t worry: it all plays out as a puzzle game. No coding experience required!</p>
<h1>Train yourself into a data science wizard!</h1>
<p>Drag objects around your screen with a mouse! Connect them with lines (oh yeah)! Try. Fail. Optimize. Try again. Then press “Release” button and see that sweet pieces of data flow smoothly through your screen.</p>
<h1>Embrace an adventurous lifestyle of a machine learning specialist!</h1>
<p>Designing a groundbreaking technology requires time, experience and money. That means you’ll have to work as a freelancer, with all the excitement that comes along with it. Receive emails! Accept contracts! Sit alone in a dark room for days without saying a single word! Socialize on forums! That’s what real data scientists do!</p>
<h1>Coding just got real!</h1>
<p>Our quests are based on actual problems, solved by machine learning. This includes building a self-driving car (with your cat as a pilot). And if you really want to test your programming might, you can become a CTO of a startup: it’s your skills and your schemes against the savage laws of the market! Earn a fortune, flip off your bosses and become a tech guru… Or lose everything and crawl back to the doorstep of HR department: at least it was worth trying, right?</p>
<h1>Improve your gear, improve your life!</h1>
<p>Once you ensure a stable cashflow, you’ll be able to buy yourself a bunch of fancy hardware to improve your performance. But it’s not just about the hardware! Buy yourself a new smartphone or a geeky figurine! Buy fancy outfits for your cat! Hell, you can even buy yourself an aloe!</p>
<h1>Fun fact</h1>
<p>This is what machine learning specialists actually do. Now, you can become one of them (minus the money)! <strong>while True: learn()</strong> is the best game about being a data science specialist because no one else has been weird enough to make another one!</p>

XCOM 2,,"ESRB T, PEGI 16",,"<p>XCOM 2 is the sequel to XCOM: Enemy Unknown, the 2012 award-winning strategy game of the year.</p>
<p>Earth has changed. Twenty years have passed since world leaders offered an unconditional surrender to alien forces. XCOM, the planet’s last line of defense, was left decimated and scattered. Now, in XCOM 2, the aliens rule Earth, building shining cities that promise a brilliant future for humanity on the surface, while concealing a sinister agenda and eliminating all who dissent from their new order.</p>
<p>Only those who live at the edges of the world have a margin of freedom. Here, a force gathers once again to stand up for humanity. Always on the run, and facing impossible odds, the remnant XCOM forces must find a way to ignite a global resistance, and eliminate the alien threat once and for all.</p>
<p>XCOM ON THE RUN: Take command of the Avenger, an alien supply craft converted to XCOM’s mobile headquarters. New open-ended gameplay lets you decide where to guide your strike team, how to grow popular support, and when to combat enemy counter-operations.</p>
<p>RECRUIT RESISTANCE FIGHTERS: Five soldier classes, each with its own skill tree, let you create specific soldiers for your tactical plan.</p>
<p>TACTICAL GUERRILLA COMBAT: New gameplay systems offer more tactical flexibility in combat. Use concealment to ambush enemy patrols. Loot enemies for precious gear and artifacts. Rescue VIPs and save fallen comrades by carrying them to the extraction point.</p>
<p>A NEW BREED OF ENEMY: A diverse cast of enemies from powerful new alien species to the ADVENT, enforcers of the alien regime, offer a distinct tactical challenge.</p>
<p>RESEARCH, DEVELOP AND UPGRADE: Configure and build rooms on the Avenger to give XCOM new capabilities on the battlefield. Use your Scientists and Engineers to research, develop and upgrade weapons and armor to fit your preferred tactics.</p>
<p>EACH MISSION IS A UNIQUE CHALLENGE: Go on missions around the world, from wildlands to the heart of the alien-controlled megacities, to the depths of alien installations. There are virtually infinite combinations of maps, missions and goals.</p>
